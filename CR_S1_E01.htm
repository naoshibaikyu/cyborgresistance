Narrator: In a not too distant future, lies ruins of a familiar lab. ...Er, wait is that Dr. Light's lab? What happened?! WHAT? [flips through the script] B-but it's not 21XX! How long was I on vacation?! I thought it was 4 years!!

[A piece of rubble rolls off as the pile under it shakes]

Narrator: *gasp* What's this? A survivor? Can it be...?

[A hand sprouts of it and the Narrator screams as he gets pulled in by it, disappearing into the rubble]

Narrator: [in the rubble] HELP ME THEY'RE GONNA EAT ME OFAJSGK;SJHLKSAGFLSHDGL;SFAGDKNDG;FKSDGASF AUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

HornetShocked: [pops out of the ground with him] What the fuck, stop fucking screaming!! What the FUCK were you doing?! 

Narrator: Uh I-

HornetShocked: YOU WERE SUPPOSE TO PULL ME OUT OF IT. NOT DRAG YOURSELF INTO THE PIT WITH ME LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF ZOMBIE PULLING YOU IN.

Narrator: Sorry, I just wanted a dramatic scene.

HornetShocked: I WAS LOSING AIR, ASSHOLE. DON'T YOU EVER PUT YOUR NEED FOR DRAMATIC NARRATION OVER MY LIFE EVER AGAIN.

Narrator: Wait, but aren't you a robot? How can you breath-

HornetShocked: WE'RE CYBORGS.

Narrator: Oh. Well back to my narrating post! ***[whooosh]***

HornetGlare ...

Magma: [blasts out of a pile of rubble and climbs out] Hoyyyyy, that was a killer party. What even happened and where are the others?

HornetHappy: Beats me!!! I can't even remember, my head fuckin hurts. As does my body. Holy shit. EVERYTHING HURTS. FUCK. AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

Magma: Same

GalaxyAngry: [flying into the scene in UFO mode] WHAT THE HELL?! I told you all to not mess with the generator!!! Now everything is gone!!

Magma: What generator?

GalaxyAngry: The galactic portal one!

HornetAngry: I STILL DON'T REMEMBER. FUCK.

GalaxyPissed: Chill!!!

MagmaAnnoyed: You're the one that jumped right to the conclusion we blew up Dr. Light's lab!!

Galaxy: Ok. Fair Point.

HornetAngry: YEAH! COULD'VE BEEN YOUR DUMBASS THAT DID IT FOR WHAT WE ALL KNOW!

...


Galaxy: Hey! Do you sense that?

HornetGlare No.

Magma: Ya.

Hornet: You do??

Magma: Yeah! The atmosphere suddenly feels so boring, lazy and completely aloof all of a sudden...

GalaxyHappy: It must be our leader. Save him!

MagmaHappy: Okay, we just gotta find the source of the boredom we're suddenly feeling.

HornetHappy: That doesn't make sense!

Magma: Of course it does! Concrete emits boredom through his face, so the more you feel the aloofness, the closer he is.

HornetGlare Since when can he even do t-

MagmaHappy: Let's find him!

GalaxyHappy: Yeah. [flies around the remains of the lab on near ground level]

HornetHappy: Well, whatever. I'm not moving from this spot.

MagmaAnnoyed: [on one side] I'm not even sensing it much here...

Galaxy: [on the other side] Me neither.

Hornet: [staying on the same exact spot] Me three.

MagmaAnnoyed: That's because ya sitting there like a dolt. Move already and help!

HornetHappy: No.

Galaxy: [on the center] Close... But still not there. 

MagmaAnnoyed: [at around the entrance's remains] Nothing here either.

HornetGlare [still on the same exact spot] Meh. Still nothing.

GalaxyAngry: Dude, come on.

HornetGlare I'm too lazy to really care and my headache is getting worse. I don't even feel like screaming or swearing anymore.

MagmaAnnoyed: ...

Galaxy: Huh?

HornetGlare I'm gonna take a na- 

MagmaAngry: [shoves Hornet to the side and blasts a hole where he was sitting] 

HornetGlare What the heck????

MagmaHappy: [pulls Concrete Man right out of the spot] Found him!

ConcreteAloof: ![](/images/misc/concrete.png) [stops emitting the boredom signal]

GalaxyHappy: Good.

HornetAngry: Tell me to move next time asshole!

MagmaAnnoyed: You wouldn't have moved even if I told you.

HornetGlare Piss off. My gigantic headache is finally clearing and you're still a pain!

GalaxyAnnoyed: Man, you must've been stuck with Concrete for hours.

ConcreteAloof: ![](/images/misc/concrete.png)

MagmaHappy: Right. We still need to find the others!

GalaxyHappy: So that's 4 of us, so 3 more to go.

MagmaAnnoyed: Wait, I thought there were nine of us!

Galaxy: Jewel Woman told us she went on a mission, remember? And Tornado just went AWOL for days.

HornetGlare We just told you we can't remember shit!

GalaxyAnnoyed: Screw you. I still have my memory tact because I went shopping before you blew up the place!

HornetAngry: WE DIDN'T DO IT!!!

GalaxyAnnoyed: How would you know? You've lost your memory!

HornetShocked: I DON'T HAVE AMNESIA. I JUST DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PARTY.

GalaxyHappy: #SelectiveAmnesia ┐(￣∀￣)┌	

HornetShocked: OH YEAH WELL FUCK YOU! ALL YOU EVER DID WAS JERK OFF IN THE STORE OR SOMETHIN'

GalaxyAnnoyed: ...What? (￣□￣」)

HornetAngry: YEAH, GOTCHA THERE DIDN'T I?

MagmaAnnoyed: Uh...

Hornet: Yea?

ConcreteAloof: ![](/images/misc/concrete.png)

Hornet: Fuck off.

ConcreteAloof: ![](/images/misc/concreteright.png)

HornetAngry: You're giving me a headache again!!

ConcreteAloof: ![](/images/misc/concretedownright.png)

Hornet: Leave me alone!!!

ConcreteAloof: ![](/images/misc/concreteupsidedown.png)

HornetShocked: FUCKING STOP

ConcreteAloof: ![](/images/misc/concretespin1.gif)

HornetPissed: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
