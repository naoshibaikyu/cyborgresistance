HornetGlare: [flipping through channels] Fuckin' nothing good is on TV today...

FakeAnnoyed: Then stop flipping channels, you've been at it for 30 minutes.

HornetGlare: [keeps pressing the button on the remote] But I'm hoping to catch a fuckin' good show on. You can just mind your own damned business.

FakeShocked: But you've cycled through all the channels 5 times...

HornetGlare: Meh. [still flipping]

FakeAnnoyed: Make that 6.

HornetGlare: Ah, shut it. Not like you have any better ideas.

Fake: ...

FakeSnicker: Well, I've managed to snag a copy of the Nintendo Wii U Classic.

Hornet: ...

FakeAnnoyed: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

Hornet: When did you get in here? Whatever. Not interested anyways.

[Hornet stops channel flipping and it eventually stops at a show called "Super Salmon Ninja Squad".]

HornetGlare: Oh god...

Fake: What's wrong? It's a popular show amongst kids and even adults like us!

Hornet: Well, count me out on being part this stupid trash's braindead audience. Nowadays all the popular shows are about Ninjas, Samurais and whatever else. But never pirates. Pirates!!!

Fake: Maybe Pirates are just not the appeal-

HornetAngry: BULLSHIT! PIRATES DO HAVE APPEAL BECAUSE PIRATES ARE BADASS! FUCK NINJAS.

[Elsewhere in the Team's base]

Splash: And that is how you-

SplashShocked: **!!**

PlugShocked: Sacre bleu, what's wrong?

SplashNani: I've sensed some serious *dishonor* from the living room...

[Splash Man immediately darts out of his room with Plug Man following.]

HornetGlare: [watched bits of the show right before deciding to flip channels again] How do these Salmon even walk? They don't have legs anyways!

FakeAnnoyed: It's a cartoon... You're suppose to suspend belief!

[Suddenly Splash Man zooms into the scene with Plug Man arriving a few seconds later]

SplashAngry: Alright, who was it?! Who uttered such a dishonorable thing around here?!

HornetGlare: What are you talkin' about?

PlugScared: Honestly, I don't know either!!

FakeSnicker: Oh, you mean what Hornet Man had said about Ninjas?

HornetGlare: Oh yeah. That. They suck, who cares. Move on.

SplashAngry: You dare dishonor my clan?

Hornet: Piss off, loser. Pirates are and will always be superior to your dumb little cowardly clan.

SplashNani: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

SplashAngry: First off, we're not cowards. We hide and strike at the right moment, killing our foes before they know what hit 'em! And second of-

HornetGlare: Wow. So impressive. **NOT!** Sounds like a bunch of miserable cowards in spandexes that can't even come face to face with their enemies.

SplashAngry: That's not cowardice! It's a lot harder work than you think, you ignorant-

Hornet: Spare me the insults. Pirates are infinitely cooler because they have guns, cannons, and parrots! They also raid villages and become rich from treasure hunting. Oh and not to mention they fight badass monsters like Krakens!

SplashAnnoyed: ...There is no such thing as Krakens. Not to mention from your description, Pirates sounds like a bunch of dishonorable jerks with no redeemable qualities whatsoever.

Hornet: Yeah right. They become rich too!

SplashAnnoyed: I said *redeemable* qualities.

HornetAnnoyed: What did you say?!

Splash: Face it. Ninjas are more popular for a reason these days! Pirates will never be as popular as Ninjas will ever be because they lack honor!

HornetAngry: *Bullshit.* **BULLSHIT.** ***B U L L S H I T!***

Splash: Sorry, but it's the truth.

Hornet: Then we should do a vote!





gggggggggggggggggg



HornetAngry: 


Hornet: I thought they've stopped at the Gamecube...

FakeAnnoyed: Oh no. They decided to make a Classic Mini Edition of your favorite system.

HornetAnnoyed: Piss off. I've hated it.

Fake: Ya sureee?

HornetGlare: Yes.

HornetAnnoyed:

Hornet: What's in it.

FakeHappy: Comes with 30 classic games.

HornetGlare: Bullshit. There's only less than half of that.

FakeSnicker: Yeah but I bet you've never heard of Funky Barn!

Hornet: ...How much are you willing to sell it for?

FakeShocked: Uh...

FakeAngry: $300

Hornet: **Sold!** [takes out his wallet and hands over his $300]



Magma: Guess what guys!?

Hornet: Shut up! I'm trying to play the Wii U Classic Mini!! [continues playing the small and odd plug-n-play system]

Magma: I'm now a pirate for no reason! Arrrr!! [pirate hat and eyepatch suddenly appears]

Plug: Me too! [same]

HornetAngry: WHAT!? WHAT ABOUT ME?! [same]

Hornet: FUCK YEAH!!!! [throws Mini GamePad out of the window]

GalaxyAngry: [gets hit in the head by the Mini GamePad] (x0x) **KOed**

Magma: Arrr! Let's find some lost treasure!!

Plug: Arrr!

Hornet: ARRR!!!

ConcreteAnnoyed: [shakes head no position]

Plug: Mon ami, I don't think Concrete Man likes fun.

MagmaAnnoyed: Yeah! What crawled up your ass and died!?

HornetShocked: [shoots bees at Concrete Man and they all eat him until he's nothing but a wishbone]

Plug: woa

Hornet: Let's make a wish!!

Magma: I wish we have a pirate ship!! [breaks wishbone]

(Pirate ship suddenly appears outside)

GalaxyShocked: [wakes up and sees a pirate ship dropping onto the pool] (°o°) ... **(°ロ°)!**

![](assets/images/mugshots/hornetglare.png) ![](assets/images/mugshots/magmahappy.png)**Hornet Man and Magma Man:** HELL YEAH!

[They go to their pirate ship.]

Magma: Arrr, all aboard the S.S. Magma!

HornetAngry: Wait a minute... DO WE EVEN HAVE A MAP?! HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND TREASURE WITHOUT A MAP?!

GalaxyHappy: Hi.

Magma: Ahoy!

HornetAngry: WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU COME FROM?!

Galaxy: Huh.

HornetShocked: DON'T FUCKING *Huh* ME YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!! ***WHY ARE YOU HERE?!***

GalaxyAnnoyed: I have the treasure maps and I want to join you guys. (´_`)

HornetAnnoyed: Ughhhh... *Fine...*

GalaxyHappy: Yay! [hands over the map]

Magma: Excellent, matey. You're already my most useful crew member! [takes map] Time to set sail! Onwards to the sea!!

(The Pirate ship sets sail. Wow that was a lazy way to write that. Who it you am think was I think me am is?)

Magma: Alright, mateys. Listen up! As pirates, ye' all do as I say as I am the captain of the crew. We are gon' get that booty and become rich!

GalaxyHappy: [snickers]

MagmaAnnoyed: Excuse me?

GalaxyHappy: You said booty and... oh...

MagmaAngry: I know what job ye scallywag will have now... You shall clean the poop deck whenever it's a mess and do absolutely nothing else! 'less you want to be shark bait...

GalaxyShocked: (°ロ°)

Galaxy: Wait, if I have to clean the *poop* deck while it's dirty, doesn't this mean I always have to clean it because-

MagmaAngry: ...

GalaxyShocked: Heh. Heh. Get it? Because... poo...

MagmaAngry: ...

Hornet: Hey, you chucklefucks! What am I suppose to do?!

Plug: Same.

Magma: Cranchio, you scout on the Crow's Nest and tell us when there's a threat nearby! We can't afford to be unguarded out in the dangerous sea!

HornetAngry: HEY! I SAID WHAT ABOUT ME?!

Magma: Dunno, do whatever ya want.

HornetAnnoyed: Ugh. I'm going to play games then.

[Hornet then remembers he left them at home]

Hornet: Fuck.
