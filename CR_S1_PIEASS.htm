HornetGlare: [flipping through channels] Fuckin' nothing good is on TV today...

FakeAnnoyed: Then stop flipping channels, you've been at it for 30 minutes.

HornetGlare: [keeps pressing the button on the remote] But I'm hoping to catch a fuckin' good show on. You can just mind your own damned business.

FakeShocked: But you've cycled through all the channels 5 times...

HornetGlare: Meh. [still flipping]

FakeAnnoyed: Make that 6.

HornetGlare: Ah, shut it. Not like you have any better ideas.

Fake: ...

FakeSnicker: Well, I've managed to snag a copy of the Nintendo Wii U Classic.

Hornet: ...

FakeAnnoyed: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

Hornet: When did you get in here? Whatever. Not interested anyways.

[Hornet stops channel flipping and it eventually stops at a show called "Super Salmon Ninja Squad".]

HornetGlare: Oh god...

Fake: What's wrong? It's a popular show amongst kids and even adults like us!

Hornet: Well, count me out on being part this stupid trash's braindead audience. Nowadays all the popular shows are about Ninjas, Samurais and whatever else. But never pirates. Pirates!!!

Fake: Maybe Pirates are just not the appeal-

HornetAngry: BULLSHIT! PIRATES DO HAVE APPEAL BECAUSE PIRATES ARE BADASS! FUCK NINJAS.

[Elsewhere in the Team's base]

Splash: And that is how you-

SplashShocked: **!!**

PlugShocked: Sacre bleu, what's wrong?

SplashNani: I've sensed some serious *dishonor* from the living room...

[Splash Man immediately darts out of his room with Plug Man following.]

HornetGlare: [watched bits of the show right before deciding to flip channels again] How do these Salmon even walk? They don't have legs anyways!

FakeAnnoyed: It's a cartoon... You're suppose to suspend belief!

[Suddenly Splash Man zooms into the scene with Plug Man arriving a few seconds later]

SplashAngry: Alright, who was it?! Who uttered such a dishonorable thing around here?!

HornetGlare: What are you talkin' about?

PlugScared: Honestly, I don't know either!!

FakeSnicker: Oh, you mean what Hornet Man had said about Ninjas?

HornetGlare: Oh yeah. That. They suck, who cares. Move on.

SplashAngry: You dare dishonor my clan?

Hornet: Piss off, loser. Pirates are and will always be superior to your dumb little cowardly clan.

SplashNani: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

SplashAngry: First off, we're not cowards. We hide and strike at the right moment, killing our foes before they know what hit 'em! And second of-

HornetGlare: Wow. So impressive. **NOT!** Sounds like a bunch of miserable cowards in spandexes that can't even come face to face with their enemies.

SplashAngry: That's not cowardice! It's a lot harder work than you think, you ignorant-

Hornet: Spare me the insults. Pirates are infinitely cooler because they have guns, cannons, and parrots! They also raid villages and become rich from stealing treasure! Oh and not to mention they fight badass monsters like Krakens!

SplashAnnoyed: ...There is no such thing as Krakens. Not to mention from your description, Pirates sounds like a bunch of dishonorable jerks with no redeemable qualities whatsoever.

Hornet: Yeah, right! They become rich too!

SplashAnnoyed: I said *redeemable* qualities.

HornetAnnoyed: What did you say?!

Splash: Face it. Ninjas are more better for a reason! Pirates will never be as popular as Ninjas will ever be because they lack honor and dignity! They're just a bunch of corrupt fools that only have money for gain!

HornetAngry: *Bullshit.* **BULLSHIT.** ***B U L L S H I T!***

Splash: Sorry, but it's the truth.

HornetAnnoyed: Well yeah?! Cranch, what do you think?

Plug: Ummm... I was always partial to pir-

SplashAngry: ...

PlugHappy: On second thought!

HornetAngry: **...**

PlugAnnoyed: Uhm... Actually

SplashNani: **...**

PlugScared: That is...

HornetPissed: <font color="red"><b>...</b></font>

PlugShocked: **EEK!!** Sorry, my friend but I ch-choose pirates.

Splash: *Sigh*

HornetGlare: Good.

GalaxyHappy: Hoi! May I chime in to the conversion?

SplashHappy: Yes!

HornetGlare: No.

GalaxyHappy: Well, personally, I prefer Ninjas. They're so stealthy and cool! They even have these cool little star throwing sharp thingies!

SplashHappy: Good! Glad someone agrees.

HornetAnnoyed: Grrrr...

ConcreteAloof: ...

HornetGlare: ...

SplashAnnoyed: You know he isn't gonna talk. Don't bother.

Hornet: Yeah, I know...

FakeHappy: Well, personally I prefer Pirate Ninjas!

Hornet: There's no such thing!

FakeSnicker: Yes there is!

SplashAnnoyed: Fakette, please don't group up Ninjas with such disgraceful and hateful things... 

Fake: I take it you don't get along with Pirates, huh?

SplashAnnoyed: I don't want to talk about it.

Hornet: Whatever! This conversation is over!

SplashAngry: Fine! I'm out! [heads back to his room]

GalaxyHappy: Well, guess I'm gonna go grocery shopping! [walks out the door]

Fake: ...But you do this every day. We have so much food already!

GalaxyAnnoyed: Huh? You're right but whatever!

[As Galaxy Man heads out to the outdoors, Fakette turns to Hornet wanting to go back to the previous conversation]

Fake: So... would you rather talk about the Wii U Classic Mini?

HornetGlare: But I thought they've stopped at the Gamecube.

FakeAnnoyed: Oh no. They've just actually decided to make a Classic Mini Edition of your favorite system.

HornetAnnoyed: Piss off. I've hated it.

Fake: Ya sureee?

HornetGlare: Yes.

HornetAnnoyed: ...

Hornet: What's in it.

FakeHappy: [holding a regular Wii U box with a paper taped onto it with written in a marker] 30 amazing games it says!

HornetGlare: Bullshit. There's only less than half of that.

FakeSnicker: Yeah? I bet you've never heard of Funky Barn!

Hornet: ...How much are you willing to sell it for?

Fake: Uh... $500?

Hornet: **Sold!** [takes out his wallet and hands over his $500]

FakeShocked: O-Oh. Well, I didn't expect an actual sale. Aheh.... [hands over the box]

Hornet: Whatever! Hooking it up now! [opens the box]

[Suddenly Magma Man barges in from his trip outdoors.]

Magma: Guess what!?

Hornet: Shut up! I'm trying to boot up the Wii U Classic Mini!!

HornetGlare: ...Hmm, the size of the system doesn't look small...

Magma: I'm now a pirate for no reason! Arrrr!! [pirate hat and eyepatch suddenly appears]

PlugHappy: Oh! Oh! Can I be a Pirate too? [pirate hat appears too] Yeah!

HornetAngry: WHAT!? WHAT ABOUT ME?! [same]

Hornet: FUCK YEAH!!!! [throws the GamePad out of the window]

GalaxyAngry: [gets hit in the head by the Mini GamePad] (x0x) **KOed**

Magma: Arrr! Let's find some lost treasure!!

Plug: Arrr!

Hornet: ARRR!!!

ConcreteAnnoyed: [shakes head no position]

Plug: I don't think Concrete Man likes fun.

HornetAnnoyed: Yeah! What crawled up your ass and died!?

ConcreteAloof: ...

HornetAngry: You know what? EAT THIS!! *shoots out tons of killer bees towards him*

ConcreteAloof: [manages to rolls away successfully, but accidentally leaves behind a wishbone he had from a turkey dinner]

Hornet: Dammit!

PlugHappy: Oh, look! A wishbone! We can make a wish by breaking it into two!

Hornet: I want a pet parrot before we get a ship!

MagmaHappy: Yeah?! Well we still need a pirate ship!!

[Hornet Man and Magma Man hold the wishbone and snap it in half. Fortunately for Magma Man, he got the longer piece to grant his wish.]

Hornet: Fuck.

[The pirate ship suddenly appears outside]

GalaxyShocked: [wakes up and sees a pirate ship dropping onto the pool] (°o°) ... **(°ロ°)!**

MagmaGiddy: Arrr, there it is, lads! All aboard the S.S. Magma!

HornetAngry: Dammit! I hope I get a pet parrot on our way then!

Magma: You can get both a parrot and treasure in one journey you know! I bet there's plenty of both at the destination!

Hornet: I guess.

[The three goes to board the ship, unknowingly with Galaxy Man curiously trailing behind them.]

PlugHappy: This is bigger than I expected!

MagmaAnnoyed: Yeah. I think we might need a bigger crew than this.

HornetGlare: Too bad everyone else preferred Ninjas...

MagmaAngry: Well they ain't belonging to our crew for sure!!

Hornet: Exactly!

GalaxyHappy: Hi.

Magma: Ahoy!

HornetAngry: Get lost! You've picked Ninja!

Galaxy: Huh. I just wanted to see what you all are upto...

Magma: Even if he did, look at it this way. He will realize the errors of his ways and become a true pirate!

HornetAnnoyed: Ughhhh... *Fine...* But listen here, you better not do anything funny... Or else.

MagmaHappy: Welcome to the crew, Galaxy Man! I think we can do with four to set sail. Arr! Time to set sail, lads!

(The pirate ship slowly sails towards out of the pool and drags across the land, creating a huge grass-destroying path behind.)

Magma: Alright, mateys. Listen up! As pirates, ye' all do as I say as I am the captain of the crew. We are gon' get that booty and become rich!

GalaxyHappy: [snickers]

MagmaAnnoyed: Eh?

GalaxyHappy: You said booty and... oh...

MagmaAngry: I know what job ye scallywag will have now... You shall clean the poop deck whenever it's a mess and do absolutely nothing else! 'less you want to be shark bait...

GalaxyShocked: (°ロ°)

Galaxy: Wait, if I have to clean the *poop* deck while it's dirty, doesn't this mean I always have to clean it because-

MagmaAngry: ...

GalaxyShocked: Heh. Heh. Get it? Because... poo...

MagmaAngry: ...

Hornet: Hey, you chucklefucks! What am I suppose to do?!

Plug: Same.

Magma: Cranchio, you scout on the Crow's Nest and tell us when there's a threat nearby! We can't afford to be unguarded out in the dangerous sea!

HornetAngry: HEY! I SAID WHAT ABOUT ME?!

Magma: Dunno, do whatever ya want.

HornetAnnoyed: Ugh. I'm going to play the Wii U Classic then.

[Hornet Man then remembers he left the system at home]

HornetGlare: Fuck.

Act 2


Hornet: Wow this is fucking boring, nothing is even fucking happening.

Hornet: Wow, way to give up you dumb little shit.

Galaxy: THAT'S IT! ＼(｀0´)／ *takes out a pirate sword and stabs it through Hornet Man's stomach*

Hornet: HURK!!!

Galaxy: *grabs Hornet Man's head and snaps his necK*

Hornet: GACK *falls over dead*

(That didn't happen)

*FWOOOSH*

Hornet: Well...?

Galaxy: *tries stabbing him with the pirate sword but it breaks*

Hornet: ...

Galaxy: *grabs Hornet Man's head and tries to twist it*

Hornet: ...

Galaxy: (ｏ`皿′ｏ)

Hornet: GET THE FUCK OFF *throws him into a barrel*

Galaxy: glubglubglub

(The ship sails across a city)

*people getting crushed by the ship*

People: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Magma: Wow, shut the fuck up.

Hornet: YEAH, YOU STUPID FISH!!! WE'RE TRYING TO FIND TREASURE!!!

Plug: *looking from the crow nest* Uh oh, guys!!!! Pirate ships!!!

*police cars surrounds the ship*

Magma: What?!

Hornet: HOW DARE THEY INTERUPT US?! *shoots an army of bees at the Police*

Magma: *shoots giant fireballs at the Police Cars*

Police Cars: FUCK *explodes*

*ice cream stand*

Plug: Oh no! Watch out for the iceberg!!!

Magma: *tries to steer the ship away from the iceberg but its too late......*

Ice Cream Stand: *crushed* AUGHHHHHH!!! 

Magma: Well, what do ya know, we're still alive! Take that Titanic!!

Hornet: YEAH FUCK YOU!!! OUR SHIP IS BETTER!!

Galaxy: glubglubglub *trying to get out of the barrel*

Hornet: Shut up.

(Suddenly the ship crashes into a pet shop)

Bird: *gets free from the shop and flies to Magma Man's shoulder* ERR HEE HEE

Pet shop owner: Hey! You forgot to pay! *building collaspes on him* AGH!!!

Hornet: HOLY SHIT, YOU HAVE A BIRD!!

Magma: HELL YEAH! Now I'm a true pirate cap'n. Arrr!!!

Bird: ERR HEE HEE, I'M NOT A PARROT YOU DUMB PIECES OF SHIT!!

Hornet: Let's name him Flicky.

Bird: I AM FLICKY!!

Hornet: Oh...

TO BE CONTINUED


ACT 3

(Meanwhile, there's a boat full of ninjas... wait, Ninjas?! HA HAAAHUUUURGHGHH *gets his throat slit*)

Thinking Ninja: Why did you murder the narrator?!

Mako: *wearing a ninja costume* Because he has my wood. *crouches down to loot the Narrator's corpse but doesn't see any wooden planks* Damn it! He must of have hid it somewhere!

Bloated Ninja: *looking at the corpse* Are you gonna finish that?

Mako: Shut up! Or maybe it was YOU who has my wood!

Bloated Ninja: ...

Angry Ninja: That's fucking disgusting!

Mako: What?

Thinking Ninja: I think he's talking about wooden planks, not that...

Angry Ninja: That's stupid. He's talking about youknowwhat. Why aren't you thinking?!

Thinking Ninja: Sorry...

Mako: What? Well being that our boat is smaller in which we can't fit anyone in it must be bigger.

Cowardly Ninja: GUYS, I'M REALLY GETTING CLAUSTROPHOBIC HERE!!!! ( ；´Д｀)

Mako: Well I'm not going to expand the ship until I see who has my wood because I want to build my ship! - -

Thinking Ninja: Why did you even let us set sail when our ship wasn't even close to being ready? Why do we have to settle with this tiny boat? I must ponder about this...

Angry Ninja: Seriously, you shit dick. Can't we just go back to the city and buy the fucking wood and get on with it?

Mako: No! We're too far from it now!

Angry Ninja: WE'RE ONLY A COUPLE YARDS AWAY FROM THE DOCKS, GENIUS.

(Suddenly an explosion from the distance was heard and shook the docks due to the intense rumble; making the boat rock a bit on the water)

Cowardly Ninja: IT'S THE END OF US ALL!!!

Angry Ninja: The fuck was that?

(Suddenly a familiar pirate ship flew from the source of the explosion lands onto the water near the small boat; causing a huge tidal wave catching the unfortunate Ninja boat and its crew with it)

Ninjas: WOAHHH!! *falls out of the boat*

Mako: *resurfaces* Weird.

Angry Ninja: *resurfaces* Is that all you can say?! We just potentially lost half of our crew from that!

Thinking Ninja: *resurfaces* Well, that's what you think!

Cowardly Ninja: *resurfaces* Oh my god, I'm alive!! IT'S A MIRACLE!!

Bloated Ninja: *is floating due to the bloat* Can I eat that?

Mako: Wait a minute... all those wooden materials... They have my wood!

Angry Ninja: ...Are you serious?

Thinking Ninja: Yeah, I mean it's not like wood is a common resource or anything.

Mako: Shut up!!!! We must train ourselves to prepare combat against the pirates!

Thinking Ninja: What?

Mako: OKAY! BULLET DODGE TRAINING! GO! *aims gun at a ninja and shoots*

A random ninja: *tries to dodge the bullet right after the gun is fired but gets shot in the head instantly then dies; sinks into the depths of the ocean*

Cowardly Ninja: AHHHHHHHHHHH!! ヽ（゜ロ゜；）ノ

Thinking Ninja: We can't dodge bullets!

Mako: Yes you can! We're ninjas; we have super human speed!

Angry Ninja: ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED?!

Mako: *shoots another Ninja* DODGE!!!

Thinking Ninja: *gets shot in the head and dies too*

Mako: THINKING NINJA! WHY AREN'T YOU THINKING?!

Mad Ninja: YOU'RE FUCKING KILLING US OFF YOU IDIOT! *forcefully grabs the gun off Mako's hands and throws it into the water*

Mako: Fine. Go attack the pirates while I try to take wood from their ship.

Mad Ninja: NOW WE'RE TALKING! LET'S GO, ASSHOLES!!!

(At the ship. Oh hey, I'm back alive!!! I'm IMMORTAL!!! HMHMHMHMHMHM...)

Hornet: SHUT THE FUCK UP

Galaxy: *gets out of the barrel* YEAH!!! FREEDOM!!!!

Hornet: I SAID SHUT UP

Galaxy: Yeah well, screw you too.

Magma: No one cares.

Galaxy: Well I guess I'm not welcome here any-*gets stab in the back* AUGHHH!! *falls over and sees a mysterious figure* Who... are... you...

Skinny Ninja: You am murderer. *jumps out of the ship and hits a rock* *SPLAT*

Skinny Ninja didn't bounce.

Galaxy: Griefer

Flicky: ERR HEE HEE, SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU LITTLE SHIT.

Galaxy: Screw this. I am gone! t(UmUt)

Hornet: GOOD! No one misses you- *gets stab in the back too* URK! *turns around and sees a mysterious figure* Who the FUCK are you?

Bloated Ninja: You are murderer. *jumps out of the ship and sinks deep into the sea* AGUHHJHGJ *drowns*

Bloated Ninja is sleeping with the fish.

Hornet: k

Galaxy: Told you! Griefer.

Hornet: They're called Ninjas, dumbass.

Galaxy: Oh hell no! Abandon ship!

Hornet: They're not even competent, you pansy!

Galaxy: So?!

Hornet: IT MEANS THEY'RE NOT A THREAT, DUMBASS!!! ARGHHHH!!! YOU DRIVE ME INSANE!!! *grabs Galaxy Man and throws him into the barrel again*

Galaxy: glubglubglub

*CLANG*

*CLANG*

*CLANG*

Hornet: The FUCK is that noise?!

Plug: Sacre Bleu! I think someone is attacking the sides of the ship!!!

Magma: *goes to the rail of the ship and looks below* What the...

???: *hitting the side of the ship with a sword* Did it work?

Hornet: What in the FUCK are you doing?!

???: Well if you were that person is acting like the victim is retarded

Magma: What?

Hornet: What?

Plug: Quoi?

Flicky: Err?

Galaxy: glug?

Magma: Wait a minute... Mako?!

Mako: How did you knew under my ninja disguise?!

Hornet: WELL ONLY YOU WOULD SAY SOMETHING SO CONFUSING AND DUMB AT THE SAME TIME!!

Mako: Dumb!? Well you're a bunch of PIRATES!!

Magma: What?! How dare you! Pirates are better than ninjas!

Mako: How so? They have shitty weapons like guns! Pffft, like that can hit a speeding ninja! Meanwhile we have throwing stars AND swords!

Hornet: NINJAS CAN'T DODGE BULLETS, IDIOT!

Magma: And we have swords too! Ninja stars are slower than guns! Also, we have cannons! Take that!

Mako: PFFFT, cannons?! Those are just little kids toys! Stop *BLEW UP BY A CANNON BALL*

(Mako's remains splatters everywhere)

Magma: Little kids toy my ASS. Owned

Scared Ninja: *is hiding in an empty barrel* AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Hornet: What the...

Mad Ninja: You idiot, you gave away our hiding spot!

Flicky: ERR HEE HEE, YOU BOTH NINJAS ARE DEAD!

Scared Ninja: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

Mad Ninja: ACTUALLY NO BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? FUCK THIS! FUCK YOU! FUCK NINJAS! FUCK PIRATES! FUCK TREASURES! FUCK THIS STUPID JOURNEY! AND ESPECIALLY FUCK MAKO! I'M DONE! FUCKING DONE! FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING DONE!!!! ALL OF THIS FUCKING BULLSHIT OVER SOME TREASURE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST!!!

Magma: Wait a minute... you're looking for treasure too?! Aren't you all just Ninjas?

Scared Ninja: ya

Mad Ninja: At least that Mako idiot was. We just followed his orders because we didn't know better. He even had a map but I think he got it from the fuckin' internet or something.

Hornet: *looting Mako's corpse* WAIT... *takes the map and looks* ...THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE GALAXY MAN GAVE US!!

Magma Man & Mad Ninja: WHAT?!

Galaxy: glubglubglub!!!

Hornet: *smashes the barrel and grabs Galaxy Man* YOU LITTLE SHIT! WHERE DID YOU GET THE MAP FROM?!?!

Galaxy: UH...UM... somewhere ヽ(￣д￣;)ノ

Hornet: ...

Galaxy: Wikipedia and TV Tropes... ( ；´Д｀)

Hornet: FUCK THIS SHIT! I'M OUTTA HERE!

Galaxy: WAIT WAIT! THE TREASURE IS REAL! I JUST KNOW IT! （°o°；）

Galaxy: Wait! GIVE ME A CHANCE! (;° ロ°)

Galaxy: Okay! Okay! How about... if we find out the treasure is fake then I can be your punching bag for months! ヽ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉ

Hornet: YOU'RE ALREADY A PUNCHING BAG!

Galaxy: I'll buy you every Wii U games you want! (￣◇￣;)

Hornet: NOT ENOUGH!!!

Galaxy: *sarcastic* okay, fine take my pog collection.... (ーー;)

Hornet: OKAY, YOU'RE SPARED FOR NOW...

Galaxy: *in thought* I don't even have one... ヽ（´ー｀）┌

Mad Ninja: Whatever. Fuck this gay bullshit. *jumps out of the ship and swims back to the city*

Scared Ninja: (;° ロ°) ヽ（゜ロ゜；）ノ WAIT FOR ME!!! ヽ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉ *jumps out of the ship and swims away too*
