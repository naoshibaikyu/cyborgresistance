HornetGlare: [flipping through channels] Fuckin' nothing good is on TV today...

FakeAnnoyed: Then stop flipping channels, you've been at it for 30 minutes.

HornetGlare: [keeps pressing the button on the remote] But I'm hoping to catch a fuckin' good show on. You can just mind your own damned business.

FakeShocked: But you've cycled through all the channels 5 times...

HornetGlare: Meh. [still flipping]

FakeAnnoyed: Make that 6.

HornetGlare: Ah, shut it. Not like you have any better ideas.

Fake: ...

FakeSnicker: Well, I've managed to snag a copy of the Nintendo Wii U Classic.

Hornet: ...

FakeAnnoyed: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

Hornet: When did you get in here? Whatever. Not interested anyways.

[Hornet stops channel flipping and it eventually stops at a show called "Super Salmon Ninja Squad".]

HornetGlare: Oh god...

Fake: What's wrong? It's a popular show amongst kids and even adults like us!

Hornet: Well, count me out on being part this stupid trash's braindead audience. Nowadays all the popular shows are about Ninjas, Samurais and whatever else. But never pirates. Pirates!!!

Fake: Maybe Pirates are just not the appeal-

HornetAngry: BULLSHIT! PIRATES DO HAVE APPEAL BECAUSE PIRATES ARE BADASS! FUCK NINJAS.

[Elsewhere in the Team's base]

Splash: And that is how you-

SplashShocked: **!!**

PlugShocked: Sacre bleu, what's wrong?

SplashNani: I've sensed some serious *dishonor* from the living room...

[Splash Man immediately darts out of his room with Plug Man following.]

HornetGlare: [watched bits of the show right before deciding to flip channels again] How do these Salmon even walk? They don't have legs anyways!

FakeAnnoyed: It's a cartoon... You're suppose to suspend belief!

[Suddenly Splash Man zooms into the scene with Plug Man arriving a few seconds later]

SplashAngry: Alright, who was it?! Who uttered such a dishonorable thing around here?!

HornetGlare: What are you talkin' about?

PlugScared: Honestly, I don't know either!!

FakeSnicker: Oh, you mean what Hornet Man had said about Ninjas?

HornetGlare: Oh yeah. That. They suck, who cares. Move on.

SplashAngry: You dare dishonor my clan?

Hornet: Piss off, loser. Pirates are and will always be superior to your dumb little cowardly clan.

SplashNani: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

SplashAngry: First off, we're not cowards. We hide and strike at the right moment, killing our foes before they know what hit 'em! And second of-

HornetGlare: [interrupts] Wow. So impressive. **NOT!** Sounds like a bunch of miserable cowards in spandexes that jump around like idiots.

SplashAngry: That's not cowardice! It's called stealth and it's a lot of effort to put into it, you ignorant-

Hornet: Spare me the insults. Pirates are infinitely cooler because they have guns, cannons, and parrots! They also raid islands and villages, then become rich from stealing treasure! Oh and not to mention they fight badass monsters like krakens!

SplashAnnoyed: ...There is no such thing as krakens. Also going by your description of pirates, they unsuprisingly sound like a bunch of dishonorable jerks with no redeemable qualities whatsoever.

Hornet: Yeah, right! They become rich too!

SplashAnnoyed: I said *redeemable* qualities.

HornetAnnoyed: What did you say?!

Splash: Face it. Ninjas are more better for a reason! Pirates will never be as popular as Ninjas will ever be because they lack honor and dignity! They're just a bunch of corrupt fools that only want their own gain!

HornetAngry: *Bullshit.* **BULLSHIT.** ***B U L L S H I T!***

Splash: Sorry, but it's the truth.

HornetAnnoyed: Well yeah?! Cranch, what do you think?

Plug: Ummm... I was always partial to pir-

SplashAngry: ...

PlugHappy: On second thought!

HornetAngry: **...**

PlugAnnoyed: Uhm... Actually

SplashNani: **...**

PlugScared: That is...

HornetPissed: <font color="red"><b>...</b></font>

PlugShocked: **EEK!!** Sorry, my friend but I ch-choose pirates.

Splash: *Sigh*

HornetGlare: Good.

GalaxyHappy: Hoi! May I chime in to the conversion?

SplashHappy: Yes!

HornetGlare: No.

GalaxyHappy: Well, personally, I prefer Ninjas. They're so stealthy and cool! They even have these cool little star throwing sharp thingies!

SplashHappy: Good! Glad someone agrees.

HornetAnnoyed: Hmph.

ConcreteAloof: ...

Hornet: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

HornetGlare: ...

SplashAnnoyed: You know he isn't gonna talk. Don't bother.

HornetGlare: Yeah, I know.

FakeHappy: Well, personally I prefer Pirate Ninjas!

Hornet: There's no such thing!

FakeSnicker: Yes there is!

SplashAnnoyed: Ugh. Fakette, please don't group up Ninjas with such disgraceful and hateful things... 

Fake: I take it you don't get along with Pirates, huh?

SplashAnnoyed: I don't want to talk about it.

Hornet: Whatever! This conversation is over!

SplashAngry: Fine! I'm out! [heads back to his room]

GalaxyHappy: Well, guess I'm gonna go grocery shopping! [walks out the door]

Fake: ...But you do this every day. We have so much food already!

GalaxyAnnoyed: Huh? You're right but whatever!

[As Galaxy Man heads out to the outdoors, Fakette turns to Hornet wanting to go back to the previous conversation]

Fake: So... would you rather talk about the Wii U Classic Mini?

HornetGlare: But I thought they've stopped at the Gamecube.

FakeAnnoyed: Oh no. They've just actually decided to make a Classic Mini Edition of your favorite system.

HornetAnnoyed: Piss off. I've hated it.

Fake: Ya sureee?

HornetGlare: Yes.

HornetAnnoyed: ...

Hornet: What's in it.

FakeHappy: [holding a regular Wii U box with a paper taped onto it with written in a marker] 30 amazing games it says!

HornetGlare: Bullshit. There's only less than half of that.

FakeSnicker: Yeah? I bet you've never heard of Funky Barn!

Hornet: ...How much are you willing to sell it for?

Fake: Uh... $500?

Hornet: **Sold!** [takes out his wallet and hands over his $500]

FakeShocked: O-Oh. Well, I didn't expect an actual sale. Aheh.... [hands over the box]

Hornet: Whatever! Hooking it up now! [opens the box]

[Suddenly Magma Man barges in from his trip outdoors.]

Magma: Guess what!?

Hornet: Shut up! I'm trying to boot up the Wii U Classic Mini!!

HornetGlare: ...Hmm, the size of the system doesn't look small...

Magma: I'm now a pirate for no reason! Arrrr!! [pirate hat and eyepatch suddenly appears]

PlugHappy: Oh! Oh! Can I be a Pirate too? [pirate hat appears too] Yeah!

HornetAngry: WHAT!? WHAT ABOUT ME?! [same]

Hornet: FUCK YEAH!!!! [throws the GamePad out of the window]

GalaxyAngry: [gets hit in the head by the Mini GamePad] (x0x) **KOed**

Magma: Arrr! Let's find some lost treasure!!

Plug: Arrr!

Hornet: ARRR!!!

ConcreteAnnoyed: [shakes head no position]

Plug: I don't think Concrete Man likes fun.

HornetAnnoyed: Yeah! What crawled up your ass and died!?

ConcreteAloof: ...

HornetAngry: You know what? EAT THIS!! *shoots out tons of killer bees towards him*

ConcreteAloof: [manages to rolls away successfully, but accidentally leaves behind a wishbone he had from a turkey dinner]

Hornet: Dammit!

PlugHappy: Oh, look! A wishbone! We can make a wish by breaking it into two!

Hornet: I want a pet parrot before we get a ship!

MagmaHappy: Yeah?! Well we still need a pirate ship!!

[Hornet Man and Magma Man hold the wishbone and snap it in half. Fortunately for Magma Man, he got the longer piece to grant his wish.]

Hornet: Fuck.

[The pirate ship suddenly appears outside]

GalaxyShocked: [wakes up and sees a pirate ship dropping onto the pool] (°o°) ... **(°ロ°)!**

MagmaGiddy: Arrr, there it is, lads! All aboard the S.S. Magma!

HornetAngry: Dammit! I hope I get a pet parrot on our way then!

Magma: You can get both a parrot and treasure in one journey you know! I bet there's plenty of both at the destination!

Hornet: I guess.

[The three goes to board the ship, unknowingly with Galaxy Man curiously trailing behind them.]

PlugHappy: This is bigger than I expected!

MagmaAnnoyed: Yeah. I think we might need a bigger crew than this.

HornetGlare: Too bad everyone else preferred Ninjas...

MagmaAngry: Well they ain't belonging to our crew for sure!!

Hornet: Exactly!

GalaxyHappy: Hi.

Magma: Ahoy!

HornetAngry: Get lost! You've picked Ninja!

Galaxy: Huh. I just wanted to see what you all are upto...

Magma: Even if he did, look at it this way. He will realize the errors of his ways and become a true pirate!

HornetAnnoyed: Ughhhh... *Fine...* But listen here, you better not do anything funny... Or else.

MagmaHappy: Welcome to the crew, Galaxy Man! I think we can do with four to set sail. Arr! Time to set sail, lads!

(The pirate ship slowly sails towards out of the pool and drags across the land, creating a huge grass-destroying path behind.)

Magma: Alright, mateys. Listen up! As pirates, ye' all do as I say as I am the captain of the crew. We are gon' get that booty and become rich!

GalaxyHappy: [snickers]

MagmaAnnoyed: Eh?

GalaxyHappy: You said booty and... oh...

MagmaAngry: I know what job ye scallywag will have now... You shall clean the poop deck whenever it's a mess and do absolutely nothing else! 'less you want to be shark bait...

GalaxyShocked: (°ロ°)

Galaxy: Wait, if I have to clean the *poop* deck while it's dirty, doesn't this mean I always have to clean it because-

MagmaAngry: ...

GalaxyShocked: Heh. Heh. Get it? Because... poo...

MagmaAngry: ...

Hornet: Hey, you chucklefucks! What am I suppose to do?!

Plug: Same.

Magma: Cranchio, you scout on the Crow's Nest and tell us when there's a threat nearby! We can't afford to be unguarded out in the dangerous sea!

HornetAngry: HEY! I SAID WHAT ABOUT ME?!

Magma: Dunno, do whatever ya want.

HornetAnnoyed: Ugh. I'm going to play the Wii U Classic then.

[Hornet Man then remembers he left the system at home]

HornetGlare: Fuck.
