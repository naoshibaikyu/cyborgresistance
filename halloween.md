@LOCATION: DR. LIGHT'S LAB

Arrietty: Pleaasssee?

Light: No.

Arrietty: Come on!!

Light: **[sigh]** I said no, it means no, Arrietty.

Arrietty: Seriously, what's the problem?

Light: Because last year you've all made a gigantic mess and it took poor Auto *weeks* to clean up the place.

Arrietty: What? Now you're just making up excuses, we've only been living with you for a *few months* at most.

Light: Well, the answer is no and that is final.

Arrietty: Alright, fine. **[slams the door on her way out]** Stuck up old geezer, the heck is his problem lately?

MollySad: I take it Dr. Light didn't take it well seeing you setting up the Halloween party, huh?

Arrietty: Yeah, so much effort for that... Guess we can try again next year.

MollyHappy: Not so fast! We can find somewhere else to party!

Arrietty: Huh? How should we go about that?

Molly: Easy! We find a really scary looking place and party there. Like a true Halloween party!

Arrietty: Scary looking place? Like a graveyard? A haunted castle? A haunted graveyard castle?

MollySmug: You aren't scared, are you Arri?

Arrietty: Oh hell no, I am so down for that idea actually!

MollyHappy: Great! Let's gather up a few folks and search for a scary party location! Halloween's not until tommorow which is plenty of time!

Arrietty: I have someone in mind already. Hey, Dimey!

OniSilver: **[all calm and collected]** Greetings. How may I assist you?

MollyAnnoyed: **[clutching her chest, calming herself]** N-Next time please have a less startling entrance...

OniSilverHappy: My apologies, Molly. I have been practicing my scare as an Oni.

Arrietty: It sure seem to have worked on her. **[giggles]**

Arrietty: Anyways, Dimey... Would you like to help the both of us find a totally spooky place for our party?

OniSilverHappy: My scouting would provide enough to find us such a place. I'm more than glad to be of your assistance.
