<!-- Epilogue -->

@ACTNUM: ACT 1

@LOCATION: DR. LIGHT'S LAB

Arrietty: Pleaasssee?

Light: No.

Arrietty: Come on!!

Light: **[sigh]** I said no, it means no, Arrietty.

Arrietty: Seriously, what's the problem?

Light: Because last year you've all made a gigantic mess and it took poor Auto *weeks* to clean up the place.

Arrietty: What? Now you're just making up excuses, we've only been living with you for a *few months* at most.

Light: Well, the answer is no and that is final.

Arrietty: Alright, fine. **[slams the door on her way out]** Stuck up old geezer, the heck is his problem lately?

MollySad: I take it Dr. Light didn't take it well seeing you setting up the Halloween party, huh?

Arrietty: Yeah, so much effort for that... Guess we can try again next year.

MollyHappy: Not so fast! We can find somewhere else to party!

Arrietty: Huh? How should we go about that?

Molly: Easy! We find a really scary looking place and party there. Like a true Halloween party!

Arrietty: Scary looking place? Like a graveyard? A haunted castle? A haunted graveyard castle?

MollySmug: You aren't scared, are you Arri?

Arrietty: Oh hell no, I am so down for that idea actually!

MollyHappy: Great! Let's gather up a few folks and search for a scary party location, then we can party there!

Arrietty: I have someone in mind already. Hey, Dimey!

%Silver Dime splashes out of the Punch Bowl.

MollyShocked: **[startled]** *Y-YAGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!*

OniSilver: **[all calm and collected]** Greetings. How may I assist you?

MollyAnnoyed: **[clutching her chest, calming herself]** N-Next time please have a less startling entrance...

OniSilverHappy: My apologies, Molly. I have been practicing my scare as a fearsome Oni.

Arrietty: It sure seem to have worked on her. **[giggles]**

Arrietty: Anyways, Dimey... Would you like to help the both of us find a totally spooky place for our party?

OniSilver: My scouting would provide enough to find us such a place. I'm more than glad to be of your assistance.

MollyHappy: Great! I'll rally up the rest of the team.

Arrietty: Great idea, and I'll ask Roy to drive us. Let's throw us one killer Halloween Party!

%End of Act 1

@ACTNUM: ACT 2

@LOCATION: ABANDONED ROUTE

%As Dr. Light have disallowed Cyber Resistance from throwing a party at their place. Everyone has agreed that Arrietty and co should find a new party location for the whole team. However, Roy Jackson, the team's Magma Man and also their driver, only agrees to help out under the condition the search doesn't take too long as the rest of the team needs to finish their last minute costume shopping.

WitchArrietty: **[holding her map filled with dozens of locations marked red crosses]** Well, this one has to be it then. Let's stop at this place. **[points at an unmarked cemetary with an abandoned mysterious building]**

Magma0: We've been at this for a few more hours than I've anticipcated, so this will be our final stopping point.

WitchArrietty: Whoops! Sorry that I've gotten a little carried away!

Magma0Annoyed: Not to mention, I have to drive the others to the big city mall and we're running a little low on time.

OniSilver: I take it us three are the only ones prepared ahead of time?

UlalaMolly: I don't see you wearing anything right now, though.

OniSilverHappy: Of course I am. I'm an Oni this year.

UlalaMollyAnnoyed: ...By just gluing two large candy corns on your forehead?

OniSilverHappy: It is an effective low-cost Halloween costume.

UlalaMollyAnnoyed: I see...

%Soon, the team finally arrives at what is hopefully their ideal destination.

UlalaMollyHappy: Oh! There it is!

WitchArrietty: Look at the size of that castle!

UlalaMollyShocked: C-Castle?! You didn't say there would be an abandoned castle!

WitchArrietty: Oh, now are you chickening out?

UlalaMolly: Don't be silly. T-that's awesome! Totally our s-spot!

Magma0Annoyed: Strange. What would a castle be doing out here anyways?

WitchArrietty: **[Getting off of the car with Molly and Silver]** Don't know, but we're going to investigate this place to make sure it's all good.

Magma0: Right, I'll come back with the rest of the team when they're done shopping. Be safe you three.

%With that, Roy's car speeds off the scene, leaving the three at a huge graveyard with the castle in its surrounding. Soon, the three walk across the graveyard approaching the castle.

OniSilver: **[surveying the area around himself]** I sense this place has not seen any visitors in a while.

UlalaMolly: The worn down castle aside?

OniSilver: **[nods]** Not a single grave we've passed so far are from within the past several decades...

UlalaMollyShocked: **[Reading the year date of each passing tombstone]** O-oh... You may be right.

WitchArrietty: Good observation! That might make it even more spookier!

UlalaMollySad: You know, I know this was kind of my idea. But now that we're walking through a graveyard, it does feel kind of amoral to have any sort of party in a place like this...

WitchArrietty: Now that you've mention it, I guess it is a little disrespectful. But hey, more reasons that we should party in the castle instead!

UlalaMollyAnnoyed: That doesn't make it much better!
