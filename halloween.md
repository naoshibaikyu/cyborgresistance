<!-- Epilogue -->

@ACTNUM: ACT 1

@LOCATIONlightslab2: DR. LIGHT'S LAB

Arrietty: Pleaasssee?

Light: No.

Arrietty: Come on!!

Light: **[sigh]** I said no, it means no, Arrietty.

Arrietty: Seriously, what's the problem?

Light: Because last year you all made a gigantic mess and it took poor Auto *weeks* to clean up the place.

Arrietty: What? Now you're just making up excuses, we've only been living with you for a *few months* at most.

Light: Well, the answer is no and that is final.

Arrietty: Alright, fine. **[slams the door on her way out]** Stuck up old geezer, the heck is his problem lately?

Molly Sad: I take it Dr. Light didn't take it well seeing you setting up the Halloween party, huh?

Arrietty: Yeah, so much effort for that… Guess we can try again next year.

Molly Happy: Not so fast! We can find somewhere else to party!

Arrietty: Huh? How should we go about that?

Molly: Easy! We find a really scary looking place and party there. Like a true Halloween party!

Arrietty: Scary looking place? Like a graveyard? A haunted castle? A haunted graveyard castle?

Molly Smug: You aren't scared, are you Arri?

Arrietty: Oh hell no, I am so down for that idea actually!

Molly Happy: Great! Let's gather up a few folks and search for a scary party location, then we can party there!

Arrietty: I have someone in mind already. Hey, Dimey!

%Silver Dime splashes out of the Punch Bowl.

Molly Shocked: **[startled]** *Y-YAGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!*

OniSilver: **[all calm and collected]** Greetings. How may I assist you?

Molly Annoyed: **[clutching her chest, calming herself]** N-Next time please have a less startling entrance…

OniSilver Happy: My apologies, Molly. I have been practicing my scare as a fearsome Oni.

Arrietty: It sure seem to have worked on her. **[giggles]**

Arrietty: Anyways, Dimey… Would you like to help the both of us find a totally spooky place for our party?

OniSilver: My scouting would provide enough to find us such a place. I'm more than glad to be of your assistance.

Molly Happy: Great! I'll rally up the rest of the team.

Arrietty: Great idea, and I'll ask Roy to drive us. Let's throw us one killer Halloween Party!

%End of Act 1

@ACTNUM: ACT 2

@LOCATION: ABANDONED ROUTE

%As Dr. Light have disallowed Cyborg Resistance from throwing a party at their place, everyone has agreed that Arrietty and co should find a new party location for the whole team. However, Roy Jackson, the team's Magma Man and also their driver, only agrees to help out under the condition the search doesn't take too long as the rest of the team needs to finish their last minute costume shopping.

WitchArrietty: **[holding her map filled with dozens of locations marked red crosses]** Well, this one has to be it then. Let's stop at this place. **[points at an unmarked cemetary with an abandoned mysterious building]**

Magma0: This is lookin' to be the last stop, alright. The second time we doubled back to the first three stops really drained this thing's juice!

WitchArrietty: Whoops! Sorry that I've gotten a little carried away!

Magma0 Happy: That's alright, kiddo; this thing was built for racing, it's not quite used to chauffeuring yet. Gonna have to give ol' Cerberus' car battery a tune-up after I drop the others off at the mall.

OniSilver: I take it us three are the only ones prepared ahead of time?

UlalaMolly: I don't see you wearing anything right now, though.

OniSilver Happy: Of course I am. I'm an Oni this year.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: …By just gluing two large candy corns on your forehead?

OniSilver Happy: It is an effective low-cost Halloween costume.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: I see…

%Soon, the team finally arrives at what is hopefully their ideal destination.

UlalaMolly Happy: Oh! There it is!

WitchArrietty: Look at the size of that castle!

UlalaMolly Shocked: C-Castle?! You didn't say there would be an abandoned castle!

WitchArrietty: Oh, now are you chickening out?

UlalaMolly: Don't be silly. T-that's awesome! Totally our s-spot!

Magma0 Annoyed: Now what in the- what's a castle doing out here? Do you folks think it's... *haunted* or somethin'?

WitchArrietty: **[Getting off of the car with Molly and Silver]** Don't know, but we're going to investigate this place to make sure it's all good.

Magma0: Alright, don't get too scared! I’ll come back with the rest of the team when they’re done shopping. Be safe you three!

%With that, Roy's car speeds off the scene, leaving the three at a huge graveyard with the castle in its surrounding. Soon, the three walk across the graveyard approaching the castle.

UlalaMolly Sad: **[looking around the surroundings, surveying a very unsettling atmosphere]** This is looking like w-what we've wanted, huh?

WitchArrietty: **[pumps fist into the air]** Heck yeah! I can already feel a chill down my spine! Are you as excited as I am?

UlalaMolly Happy: Of course! This was my idea after all! **[smiles hesitantly]**

UlalaMolly Sad: …But you know, despite that, this does feel like an amoral idea now that we're in a graveyard.

WitchArrietty: Sure, if we were to party on the graves. That's why the castle caught my eye instead, to party indoors instead!

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Don't know if it's that much better...

OniSilver: **[surveying the area around himself]** I sense this place has not seen any visitors in a while.

UlalaMolly: Even the worn down castle aside?

OniSilver: **[nods]** Not a single grave we've passed so far are dated within the past several decades…

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[Reading the year date of each passing tombstone, confirming Silver Dime's claims]** O-oh… How about that?

WitchArrietty: Oh, good observation! That might be a long abandoned graveyard then.

OniSilver: That is correct.

WitchArrietty: Which means no one's ever around, we can party as long as we want!

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Yeahhhh, I don't think that was his point.

WitchArrietty: What was it then?

OniSilver Happy: It was just a simple observation. Nothing more.

UlalaMolly: Oh…

WitchArrietty: You're acting awfully strange right now. You don't think there's actually ghosts or the like do you, Molly? I mean, not that I would complain.

UlalaMolly Happy: Of course not! T-That's not scientific at all! Why would I believe in such silly supernatural non-sense?

WitchArrietty: Oh man, that would be *so* cool though! We'd be having the Halloween adventure of a life time!

UlalaMolly Sad: **[concerned laughter]** Hahaha… *Really into* the Halloween spirit, Arri?

%Eventually, they've finally reach to the ends of the grave yard and are right at the entrance of the castle. Excitedly, Arrietty opens the door and walks right in without much of a concern. Silver Dime follows with caution and then beckons to Molly who reluctantly enters the aged building.

WitchArrietty: Well, there it is! Our potential party place!

UlalaMolly: T-that's great! Looks scary enough for our p-party.

WitchArrietty: Well, we have yet to explore to be sure, but it is promising already!

UlalaMolly: Haha. Well, I'm about to head back and wait for everyone else while you-

WitchArrietty: Nuh-uh! You're not cowarding your way out of this! **[slams the door and immediately the door knob falls off and rolls into a hole in the floor]** 

WitchArrietty: Oops?

UlalaMolly Shocked: W-Wha?! Arri! You've broke our only way out!

WitchArrietty: I didn't even slam the door that hard!

OniSilver: **[looking around his surroundings]** Hmmm... The age of this place... It seems most unstable. While there may not be any hostile threat, we must still be cautious.

%End of Act 2

@ACTNUM: ACT 3

@LOCATIONcastle: MYSTERIOUS CASTLE

UlalaMolly Sad: **[frantically looking around for an exit]** All the windows are boarded up too! We're trapped in here!

WitchArrietty: Calm yourself! There can be a backdoor exit or something. Besides, if we reallly need to, we can just transform and blow up the door anyways.

UlalaMolly: Oh, yeah...

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: **Kyeh Heh Heh!!** What do we have here?

UlalaMolly Shocked: Zoinks!

WitchArrietty: Jinkies!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Do I hear yet another bunch of foolish kids trespassing my domain?

WitchArrietty: Kids? I'm 26 thank you very much!

UlalaMolly: And I'm only 21!

OniSilver Angry: Our age is of no relevence! **[gets in his battle stance]** Show your face, fearsome foe.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: **Kyeh Heh Heh Hehhhhhh!!** Foolish humans! You cannot stand up to the might of my guardians.

WitchArrietty: Sure, we can. And we can also kick your ass no problem, either.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: **Kyeehhh!!** A bunch of cocky kids thinking they can take on an entire castle of traps and all sorts of horrors. Heard it all before for years!

WitchArrietty: Pfft, please. That's nothing.

UlalaMolly Smug: Yeah, should we tell him?

OniSilver Happy: We can transform into our cyborgnetic forms as we please.

UlalaMolly Happy: We're the Cyborg Resistance after all!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Cyber Resistance?! Oh! **Kyeh Ha Ha Ha!!** I've heard of you. My master would be most pleased if I've captured you all! But before I go on...

%Suddenly, the whole room is surrounded in a purple mist, blinding the three and causing them to have a coughing fit. Soon after, the mist fades away into nothing and the room's visibility is cleared up.

UlalaMolly Shocked: Uh, what was that all about?!

%[Something something, they're cursed and they can't transform into their CR forms. All of that will be written here along with the the rest of Act 3.]

@ACTNUM: ACT 4 (or 5)

@LOCATIONcastle: MYSTERIOUS CASTLE

%With Molly's friends kidnapped, she has braved through the haunted castle alone. With some newfound courage she gained throughout the journey, she finally reaches to the final room where the master of the castle awaits.

UlalaMolly Sad: Okay, Molly. You can do this. This is the final confrontation... You got this far. Nothing can stop you now...

%Molly finally reaches the end of the stairway and sees the villainous vampire sitting on their throne, drinking from what it appears to be blood in a wine glass.

UlalaMolly Angry: This is the monster that took my friends.. and their lives depend on me! W-what would Arrietty do if she was in my position...?

%Molly enters into the room and immediately points at the vampire.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Die Monster! You don't belong in the world!

UlalaMolly Shocked: (Whoops! Definitely not that!)

ShadeMan: **[amused]** It was not by *my* hand that I'm once again given flesh. I was called here by *humans* who wish to pay me tribute.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: (...Roll with it.)

UlalaMolly: "Tribute"?! You steal men's souls, and make them your slaves!

ShadeMan: What is a man?! **[gets hit in the face with a plastic whip, he drops his wine and it shatters on the floor spilling tomato juice everywhere]** ...

ShadeMan Annoyed: What was that for?!

UlalaMolly Angry: No, no, no! You did it wrong and got too ahead of the script, let's start over!

ShadeMan Shocked: Fine, let's- wait! MY TOMATO JUICE! NO! **[looks around frantically, then starts licking the tomato juice off the floor]**

UlalaMolly Annoyed: ...Gross.

ShadeMan Annoyed: Look at what you've done to my tomato juice! That was my last glass! Grrr... You little brat. Kyeh... I'll...

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Should've memorized the script!

ShadeMan Scary: Enough talk! **[eyes glows red as he lunges towards Molly]]** Have at you!

UlalaMolly Shocked: EEK!!

%CHOMP!!

UlalaMolly Shocked: ...

ShadeMan Scary: ...

ShadeMan Shocked: ***DSKJFAKJEWGKDSBPKDLEGP!! KYEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!*** *GARLIC?! UAUGHJHJGKFLKGKLB* **[falls over all weakened]** *MY ENTIRE TEETH SUNK INTO GARLIC. WHY?! WHY DID WILY PROGRAM THIS WEAKNESS?! AUGH BLEHCK.*

UlalaMolly Smug: Ha! I knew even robot vampires would be weak to my garlic shield!

ShadeMan Annoyed: **[gagging hard]** You little brat! How did you even get that?! And *why* is it a shield, of all things?!

UlalaMolly Smug: And they think I'm over prepared.

WitchArrietty: **[is in a cage that is hanging from the cieling]** Give me a break! It was a pain carrying that bag to the car!

UlalaMolly Shocked: Arri?! You're alive!

UlalaMolly Happy: *YOU'RE ALIVE!*

OniSilver: **[also in a cage]** That we are. Seems we have underestimated our foe, our apologies.

UlalaMolly Happy: Fortunately, I've brought just about *every* monster weakness I can think of in that bag just for our safety!

WitchArrietty: You told me it was full of candy, you liar!

WitchArrietty: ...But I'm glad you've lied. I would've tossed the bag out if I were to find out sooner and this situation would've ended up nastier!

UlalaMolly Sad: **[unlocking the cages, freeing the two]** Yeah, yeah. Next time let's choose a less shady location.

ShadeMan Annoyed: **[mostly recovered]** Kyeh... Your decision to make a fool out of me is your ultimate demise, brat.

UlalaMolly Smug: It's three against one now, Shade Man.

WitchArrietty: You're finished!

OniSilver: I would not assume with such haste, our state leaves us very vunerable.

UlalaMolly Shocked: Eep, that's right! My bad.

ShadeMan: **Kyeh Heh Heh!!** My spell renders you all hopeless against me. And now I'm done messing with you brats. **[an eerie aura slowly forms around him]**

WitchArrietty: Molly, do you have anything else?!

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[frantically going through the bag]** There gotta be another garlic, where did I put it!?

ShadeMan Scary: Wily's wishes be damned. I shall end all of your mortal lives instead right now! **[his wings expands and his eyes glows red once again as the red glowy aura intensifies]**

WitchArrietty: We have little time! Throw whatevers in your hands and hope for the best!

UlalaMolly Happy: Aha! **[holds up a glass of Holy Water and quickly throws it at Shade Man]**

SFX: **Kssh! Splash!**

%Unfortunately, it had no effect as it is... really just water in a glass bottle.

WitchArrietty: You dolt, he's water proof!

UlalaMolly Shocked: I-I kinda knew that!

WitchArrietty: ...Might this be a good time to bring up the Laws of Robotics?

OniSilver Angry: Villains don't care about that!

ShadeMan Scary:  **Kyeh Heh Heh Heh!** Pathetic mortals, your struggle makes me pity you, so I shall let you all have your last words. But make it quick...

%As Shade Man gives them time to say their good byes, the entire castle around him begins to quake.

WitchArrietty: molly, i want to say... i love you

UlalaMolly Annoyed: ...We've been dating for months, Arri. We're girlfriends.

WitchArrietty: I know right?? I just can't believe it!!

OniSilver Angry: Brace yourselves for the worst. **[gets in a guarding stance]**

ShadeMan Scary: Farewell, mortals! See you all in *HELL*! **KYAAAAAAAHHHHH HAAAAA-

ShadeMan Shocked: **AHUSGKAGHJKADGG!!?!?** 

%Shade Man's aura suddenly gets cut short, then suddenly and inexplicably he falls to the ground, completely battered.

OniSilver Shocked: ...

WitchArrietty: ...What just happened?

UlalaMolly Shocked: Wasn't me. I had nothing else that would work in the bag!

OniSilver: Not I either!

%A white glowly spring behind where Shade Man was bounces up and down while approaching towards the three.

ShadeMan Damaged: Gah... s-springs. My one true weakness...

UlalaMolly Shocked: U-um... A-A ghost spring?

%The spring morphs into into a menancing ghostly figure.

UlalaMolly Shocked: **A-AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! A-A REAL**

WitchArrietty: **[hops excitedly]** Ghost!?

ShadeMan Shocked: WAUGHHHHH!?!?! **[hops off the ground and does a cartoonish run cycle while suspended in mid-air]** I'm out of here!!

%Shade Man zooms right through the window and falls straight down, forgetting to fly.

SFX: **CRASH!!**

WitchArrietty: I can't believe it, Molly! Ghosts really do exist! **[approaches slowly towards it]**

OniSilver Angry: Stand back, Arrietty! **[glares right at the ghostly figure]** Identify yourself.

SpookyGhost: ...

SpookyGhost: Repent...

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[visibly shakened]** AA-AAaaaaa.... R-R-R-Repent...???

SpookyGhost: **[points at the three]** Your three shall repent for your serious misdeeds...

WitchArrietty: Oh no! We've angered the spirits of the graveyard!

SpookyGhost: Your misdeeds...

OniSilver Angry: Get on with it!

SpookyGhost: Was...

%Immediately, the ghost stops glowing right before transforming quickly into a familiar face.

FakeAngry: Making us wait outside for the past 2 hours!

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[faints]**

WitchArrietty: Aw man... I thought you were a real ghost...

FakeSnicker: You all should've seen the look on your faces!

Fake: But seriously! When's the party starting? And who was that vampire-looking guy that ran by? Is he a friend of yours? Were you all partying without us?!

OniSilver Happy: No, the party has just started.

WitchArrietty: Yeah! It's one spooky of a place for it, right Molly?

WitchArrietty: ...Molly?

FakeSnicker: **[giggles at the fainted girl]** Hehe, well that's what we call a halloween scare!
