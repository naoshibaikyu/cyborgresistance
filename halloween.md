@LOCATIONlightslab2: DR. LIGHT'S LAB

Arrietty: Pleaasssee?

Light: No.

Arrietty: Come on!!
<div class="wrapper">
Light: **[sigh]** I said no, it means no, Arrietty.

Arrietty: Seriously, what's the problem?

Light: Because last year you all made a gigantic mess and it took poor Auto *weeks* to clean up the place.

Arrietty: What? Now you're just making up excuses, we've only been living with you for a *few months* at most.

Light: Well, the answer is no and that is final.

Arrietty: Alright, fine. **[slams the door on her way out]** Stuck up old geezer, the heck is his problem lately?

Molly Sad: I take it Dr. Light didn't take it well seeing you setting up the Halloween party, huh?

Arrietty: Yeah, so much effort for that… Guess we can try again next year.

Molly Happy: Not so fast! We can find somewhere else to party!

Arrietty: Huh? How should we go about that?

Molly: Easy! We find a really scary looking place and party there. Like a true Halloween party!

Arrietty: Scary looking place? Like a graveyard? A haunted castle? A haunted graveyard castle?

Molly Smug: You aren't scared, are you Arri?

Arrietty: Oh hell no, I am so down for that idea actually!

Molly Happy: Great! Let's gather up a few folks and search for a scary party location, then we can party there!

Arrietty: I have someone in mind already. Hey, Dimey!

%Silver Dime splashes out of the Punch Bowl.

Molly Shocked: **[startled]** *Y-YAGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!*

OniSilver: **[all calm and collected]** Greetings. How may I assist you?

Molly Annoyed: **[clutching her chest, calming herself]** N-Next time please have a less startling entrance…

OniSilver Happy: My apologies, Molly. I have been practicing my scare as a fearsome Oni.

Arrietty: It sure seem to have worked on her. **[giggles]**

Arrietty: Anyways, Dimey… Would you like to help the both of us find a totally spooky place for our party?

OniSilver: My scouting would provide enough to find us such a place. I'm more than glad to be of your assistance.

Molly Happy: Great! I'll rally up the rest of the team.

Arrietty: Great idea, and I'll ask Roy to drive us. Let's throw us one killer Halloween Party!

%End of Act 1

@ACTNUM: ACT 2

@LOCATION: ABANDONED ROUTE

%As Dr. Light have disallowed Cyborg Resistance from throwing a party at their place, everyone has agreed that Arrietty and co should find a new party location for the whole team. However, Roy Jackson, the team's Magma Man and also their driver, only agrees to help out under the condition the search doesn't take too long as the rest of the team needs to finish their last minute costume shopping.

WitchArrietty: **[holding her map filled with dozens of locations marked red crosses]** Well, this one has to be it then. Let's stop at this place. **[points at an unmarked cemetary with an abandoned mysterious building]**

Magma0: This is lookin' to be the last stop, alright. The second time we doubled back to the first three stops really drained this thing's juice!

WitchArrietty: Whoops! Sorry that I've gotten a little carried away!

Magma0 Happy: That's alright, kiddo; this thing was built for racing, it's not quite used to chauffeuring yet. Gonna have to give ol' Cerberus' car battery a tune-up after I drop the others off at the mall.

OniSilver: I take it us three are the only ones prepared ahead of time?

UlalaMolly: I don't see you wearing anything right now, though.

OniSilver Happy: Of course I am. I'm an Oni this year.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: …By just gluing two large candy corns on your forehead?

OniSilver Happy: It is an effective low-cost Halloween costume.

UlalaMolly Annoyed: I see…

%Soon, the team finally arrives at what is hopefully their ideal destination.

UlalaMolly Happy: Oh! There it is!

WitchArrietty: Look at the size of that castle!

UlalaMolly Shocked: C-Castle?! You didn't say there would be an abandoned castle!

WitchArrietty: Oh, now are you chickening out?

UlalaMolly: Don't be silly. T-that's awesome! Totally our s-spot!

Magma0 Annoyed: Now what in the- what's a castle doing out here? Do you folks think it's... *haunted* or somethin'?

WitchArrietty: **[Getting off of the car with Molly and Silver]** Don't know, but we're going to investigate this place to make sure it's all good.

Magma0: Alright, don't get too scared! I’ll come back with the rest of the team when they’re done shopping. Be safe you three!

%With that, Roy's car speeds off the scene, leaving the three at a huge graveyard with the castle in its surrounding. Soon, the three walk across the graveyard approaching the castle.

UlalaMolly Sad: **[looking around the surroundings, surveying a very unsettling atmosphere]** This is looking like w-what we've wanted, huh?

WitchArrietty: **[pumps fist into the air]** Heck yeah! I can already feel a chill down my spine! Are you as excited as I am?

UlalaMolly Happy: Of course! This was my idea after all! **[smiles hesitantly]**

UlalaMolly Sad: …But you know, despite that, this does feel like an amoral idea now that we're in a graveyard.

WitchArrietty: Sure, if we were to party on the graves. That's why the castle caught my eye instead, to party indoors instead!

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Don't know if it's that much better...

OniSilver: **[surveying the area around himself]** I sense this place has not seen any visitors in a while.

UlalaMolly: Even the worn down castle aside?

OniSilver: **[nods]** Not a single grave we've passed so far are dated within the past several decades…

UlalaMolly Shocked: **[Reading the year date of each passing tombstone, confirming Silver Dime's claims]** O-oh… How about that?

WitchArrietty: Oh, good observation! That might be a long abandoned graveyard then.

OniSilver: That is correct.

WitchArrietty: Which means no one's ever around, we can party as long as we want!

UlalaMolly Annoyed: Yeahhhh, I don't think that was his point.

WitchArrietty: What was it then?

OniSilver Happy: It was just a simple observation. Nothing more.

UlalaMolly: Oh…

WitchArrietty: You're acting awfully strange right now. You don't think there's actually ghosts or the like do you, Molly? I mean, not that I would complain.

UlalaMolly Happy: Of course not! T-That's not scientific at all! Why would I believe in such silly supernatural non-sense?

WitchArrietty: Oh man, that would be *so* cool though! We'd be having the Halloween adventure of a life time!

UlalaMolly Sad: **[concerned laughter]** Hahaha… *Really into* the Halloween spirit, Arri?

%Eventually, they've finally reach to the ends of the grave yard and are right at the entrance of the castle. Excitedly, Arrietty opens the door and walks right in without much of a concern. Silver Dime follows with caution and then beckons to Molly who reluctantly enters the aged building.

WitchArrietty: Well, there it is! Our potential party place!

UlalaMolly: T-that's great! Looks scary enough for our p-party.

WitchArrietty: Well, we have yet to explore to be sure, but it is promising already!

UlalaMolly: Haha. Well, I'm about to head back and wait for everyone else while you-

WitchArrietty: Nuh-uh! You're not cowarding your way out of this! **[slams the door and immediately the door knob falls off and rolls into a hole in the floor]** 

WitchArrietty: Oops?

UlalaMolly Shocked: W-Wha?! Arri! You've broke our only way out!

WitchArrietty: I didn't even slam the door that hard!

OniSilver: **[looking around his surroundings]** Hmmm... The age of this place... It seems most unstable. While there may not be any hostile threat, we must still be cautious.

%End of Act 2

@ACTNUM: ACT 3

@LOCATIONcastle: MYSTERIOUS CASTLE

UlalaMolly Sad: **[frantically looking around for an exit]** All the windows are boarded up too! We're trapped in here!

WitchArrietty: Calm yourself! There can be a backdoor exit or something. Besides, if we reallly need to, we can just transform and blow up the door anyways.

UlalaMolly: Oh, yeah...

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: **Kyeh Heh Heh!!** What do we have here?

UlalaMolly Shocked: Zoinks!

WitchArrietty: Jinkies!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Do I hear yet another bunch of foolish kids trespassing my domain?

WitchArrietty: Kids? I'm 26 thank you very much!

UlalaMolly: And I'm only 21!

OniSilver Angry: Our age is of no relevence! **[gets in his battle stance]** Show your face, fearsome foe.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: **Kyeh Heh Heh Hehhhhhh!!** Foolish humans! You cannot stand up to the might of my guardians.

WitchArrietty: Sure, we can. And we can also kick your ass no problem, either.

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: **Kyeehhh!!** A bunch of cocky kids thinking they can take on an entire castle of traps and all sorts of horrors. Heard it all before for years!

WitchArrietty: Pfft, please. That's nothing.

UlalaMolly Smug: Yeah, should we tell him?

OniSilver Happy: We can transform into our cyborgnetic forms as we please.

UlalaMolly Happy: We're the Cyborg Resistance after all!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Cyber Resistance?! Oh! **Kyeh Ha Ha Ha!!** I've heard of you. My master would be most pleased if I've captured you all! But before I go on...

%The cieling aboves them drops a little orb shaped object with its lights flickering, growing brighter right before flashing the entire room for a moment. Tons of sparks flying around from the orb's source location. 

UlalaMolly Shocked: Uh, what was even that?

WitchArrietty: A dud? A flashbang?

OniSilver Shocked: ...! I-I can't transform into Splash Man.

WitchArrietty: Wait, really?

WitchArrietty: W-What the?! What gives?! I can't transform either!

UlalaMolly Shocked: You think he dropped an EPM bomb of some sorts on us?!

MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Correct! I was saving this for a certain robot boy, but you three? This will do! Your powers are all disabled for hours, think you can survive my castle until then? I shall be waiting on my throne. So until then, farewell! **Kyeh Heh Heh!!**
