%Outside the room...

GhostPresent Annoyed: *[peeps out of a giant empty gift box]* What's taking him so long?

FutureHornet: I wish he can hurry up so this can be over with...

Fake Snicker: *[as a Christmas star]* Don't worry, I sent Concrete Man to make sure everything will be okay!

GhostPresent: Umm... I don't think Concrete-

%"*OH GOD! HE RIPPED MY <b>ARMS</b> OFF!* FOR THE LOVE OF THAT IS EVERYTHING... **HELLPPP MEEEEEEEE**"

GhostPresentShocked: EEP! *[hides back in the box]*

FakeShocked: Uhhh, so sh-

FutureHornet: Yes, we *absolutely* should.

%The two barges into the room and all they see is the room in a big mess coupled with pieces of Galaxy Man's parts.

GhostPastShocked: *[disguising herself as one of the ghosts]* Holy-

GhostFutureDamaged: *[leaking a lot of oil]* I don't want to be on Earth anymore...

HornetGiddy: YES! I'VE DEFEATED DEATH! NOW NO ONE CAN STOP ME! I AM IMMORTAL! *I AM IMMORTAL!!!*

GhostPastShocked: ...

Spike Aloof: ...

HornetGiddy: HAHAHAHAHA! NOW I CAN-

Tornado Annoyed: Violent. Oil. Acknowledge that Hornet harmed the Space Man. Yes?

GhostPast: What is wrong with you?!

GhostPresentShocked: I-I think I'm going to be sick!

HornetSad: What do you two idiots want? I've already told you to scram!

GhostPast: Do you have any idea what you've done?!

Hornet: Yes! Immortality is MINE!

GhostPresent Annoyed: He was one of us!

Hornet: Death was one of you?!

GhostPast: No! That was the Christmas Ghost of the Future!

Hornet: No, I'm pretty sure that was death. Now I'm immortal! Ha!

GhostPast Annoyed: Are you really this fucking self absorbed?

GhostPresentShocked: No! We're Christmas Ghosts! No swearing in this Christian Holiday!

GhostFutureDamaged: *[still leaking lots of oil]* Can anyone help already...

HornetGlare: *[was completely paying no attention]* Huh, did you guys say something? ...Wait, hmm? *[turns around]*

FutureHornet: ...!

HornetGlare:  *[sees his "Future" self]* What the? Grey hair and beard? Despite my immortality, I still age in the future apparently...

FutureHornet: Um, uh. *[coughs]* I am 30 years old and I'm so old and I don't feel good and... *[cough]*

Hornet: ...?!

FutureHornet: ... and... death finally caught up and got its revenge on me... *[collapses "dead"]*

HornetShocked: W-What?! NO! NO NO! MY IMMORTALITY... WHAT HAPPENED?!

GhostFutureDamaged: Guys... I think I can't feel my arms...

GhostFuturePunched: **OW**

GhostFutureDamaged: Nevermind... There it is...

HornetGlare: Shut up! I've clearly haven't punched you hard enough!

GhostPresentShocked: Stop!

Hornet: Eh?

GhostPast: Yeah! You've... uh... Lost your immortality, so your life expectancy has significantly shortened as a result!

HornetShocked: At the age of 30? Wait... oh god, that's next year! I'm going to die next year?!

HornetSad: Where have I go wrong...

GhostFutureDamaged: For starters.. you're a big fat jerk-

GhostFuturePunched: **AUGH**

GhostPast: "Death" is right! Your lack of goodwill and deeds has made you lose your immortality! Only those with good heart would keep their immortality!

HornetGlare: Wow. Not worth it.

FutureHornet: [pretends to rot]

HornetShocked: But I don't wanna die! I must change!

%To his horror, Hornet Man bolts out of the room.

FutureHornet: Uhh...

GhostPastShocked: Can I take what I've said about the prank backfiring back?

GhostFutureDamaged: ...

GhostPast Annoyed: ...
