Hornet Glare: [flipping through channels] Meh. Nothing good is on TV today...

Fake Annoyed: Then stop flipping channels, you've been at it for 30 minutes.

Hornet Glare: [keeps pressing the button on the remote] But I'm hoping to catch a good show on! You can just mind your own damned business.

Fake Shocked: But you've cycled through all the channels 5 times...

Hornet Glare: Meh. Still nothing good... [still flipping]

Fake Annoyed: Make that 6.

Hornet Glare: Oh, shut it. Not like you have any better ideas.

Fake: ...

Fake Snicker: Well, I've managed to snag a copy of the Nintendo Wii U Classic.

Hornet: ...

Fake Annoyed: ...

Spike Aloof: ...

Hornet: When did you get in here? Whatever. Not interested anyways.

%Hornet stops channel flipping and ends up at a channel displaying a show called "Super Salmon Ninja Squad".

Hornet Glare: Oh god...

Fake: What's wrong? It's a popular show amongst kids and even adults like us!

Hornet: Well, count me out on being part this stupid trash's braindead audience. Nowadays all the popular shows are about Ninjas. But never pirates. Pirates!!!

Fake: Maybe Pirates are just not the flavor of the mon-

Hornet Angry: WRONG! So so wrong. What do you even know about Pirates? You're not a sheep to the modern mainstream, are you Fakette!? ARE YOU?!

Fake Shocked: Yeesh, taking it a bit personal there. I didn't even stated my perference.

Hornet Glare: So what?! It's personal when Ninjas are somehow the "in" to everyone now. 

Fake Annoyed: They have always been popular, Hornet.

Hornet Angry: FAKETTE, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?! NINJAS ARE TRASH!! **T-R-A-S-H**

%Elsewhere in the Team's base.

Splash: And that is how you-

Splash Shocked: **!!**

Plug Shocked: Sacre bleu, what's wrong?

Splash Nani: I've sensed some serious *dishonor* from the living room...

%Splash Man immediately darts out of his room with Plug Man following.

Hornet Glare: [watched bits of the show right before deciding to flip channels again] How do these Salmon even walk? They don't have legs anyways!

Fake Annoyed: It's a cartoon... You're suppose to suspend disbelief!

%Suddenly Splash Man zooms into the scene with Plug Man arriving a few seconds later.

Splash Angry: Alright, who was it?! Who uttered such a dishonorable thing around here?!

Hornet Glare: What are you talkin' about?

Plug Scared: Honestly, I don't know either!!

Fake Snicker: Oh, you mean what Hornet Man had said about Ninjas?

Hornet Glare: Oh yeah. That. They suck, who cares?

Fake Annoyed: But didn't you get all flared up over for...

Hornet Glare: ...

Splash Angry: You dare dishonor our caste?

Hornet: I dare, loser. Pirates are and will always be superior to your dumb little inferior clan.

Splash Nani: ...

Spike Aloof: ...

Splash Angry: First off, we're not inferior! We hide and strike our foes at the right moment before they know what hit 'em! And second of-

Hornet Glare: [interrupts] Wow. So impressive. **NOT!** Sounds like a bunch of miserable cowards in spandexes that jump around like idiots.

Splash Angry: Fool! It's called stealth and there's a lot of work and skills involved, so it's not cowardice you ignorant-

Hornet: Spare me the insults. Pirates are infinitely cooler because they have guns, cannons, and parrots! They also raid islands and villages, then become rich from stealing treasure! Oh and not to mention they fight badass monsters like krakens!

Splash Annoyed: All I'm getting from this is they destroy innocent lives for profit! They have no redeemable qualities whatsoever!

Hornet: Yeah, right! They become rich!

Splash Annoyed: I said *redeemable* qualities. And krakens don't exist you disgraceful idiot!

Hornet Annoyed: What did you say?!

Splash: Face it! Pirates will never be as popular as Ninjas will ever be because they lack honor and dignity! They're just a bunch of corrupt inhumane fools!

Hornet Angry: *Bullshit.* ***BULLSHIT.*** ***B U L L S H I T!***

Splash: Sorry, but it's the truth.

Hornet Annoyed: Well yeah?! Cranch, what do you think?

Plug: Ummm... I was always partial to pir-

Splash Angry: ...

Plug Happy: On second thought!

Hornet Angry: **...**

Plug Annoyed: Uhm... Actually

Splash Nani: **...**

Plug Scared: That is...

Hornet Pissed: <font color="red"><b>...</b></font>

Plug Shocked: **EEK!!** Sorry, my friend but I ch-choose pirates.

Splash: *Sigh*

Hornet Glare: Good.

Galaxy Happy: Hoi! May I chime in to the conversion?

Splash Happy: Yes!

Hornet Glare: No.

Galaxy Happy: Well, personally, I prefer Ninjas. They're so sneaky and cool! They even have these cool little star throwing sharp thingies!

Splash Happy: Good! Glad someone agrees... even with a basic understanding.

Hornet Annoyed: Hmph.

Spike Aloof: ...

Hornet: ...

Spike Aloof: ...

Hornet Glare: ...

Splash Annoyed: You know he isn't gonna talk. Don't bother.

Hornet Glare: Yeah, I know.

Fake Happy: Well, personally I prefer Pirate Ninjas!

Hornet: There's no such thing!

Fake Snicker: Yes there is!

Splash Annoyed: Ugh. Fakette, please don't group up Ninjas with such disgraceful and hateful things... 

Fake: I take it you don't get along with Pirates, huh?

Splash Annoyed: I don't want to talk about it.

Hornet: Whatever! This conversation is over!

Splash Annoyed: You just don't wanna admit-

Hornet Glare: Go home!

Splash Angry: Fine! I'm out! [heads back to his room]

Galaxy Happy: Well, guess I'm gonna go do some grocery shopping.

Fake: ...But you do this every day. We have so much food already!

Galaxy Annoyed: Huh? You're right but whatever!

%As Galaxy Man heads out to the outdoors, Fakette turns to Hornet wanting to go back to the previous conversation

Fake: So... would you rather talk about the Wii U Classic Mini?

Hornet Glare: But I thought they've stopped at the Gamecube.

Fake Annoyed: Oh no. They've just actually decided to make a Classic Mini Edition of your favorite system.

Hornet Annoyed: Piss off. I've hated it.

Fake: Ya sureee?

Hornet Glare: Yes.

Hornet Annoyed: ...

Hornet: What's in it.

Fake Happy: [holding a regular Wii U box with a paper taped onto it with written in a marker] 30 amazing games it says!

Hornet Glare: Bullshit. There's only less than half of that.

Fake Snicker: Yeah? I bet you've never heard of Funky Barn!

Hornet: ...How much are you willing to sell it for?

Fake: Uh... $500?

Hornet: **Sold!** [takes out his wallet and hands over his $500]

Fake Shocked: O-Oh. Well, I didn't expect an actual sale. Aheh.... [hands over the box]

Hornet: Whatever! Hooking it up now! [opens the box]

%Suddenly Magma Man barges in from his trip outdoors.

Magma: Guess what!?

Hornet: Shut up! I'm trying to boot up the Wii U Classic Mini!!

Hornet Glare: ...Hmm, the mini system is the exact size as the original...

Magma: I'm now a pirate for no reason! Arrrr!! [pirate hat and eyepatch suddenly appears]

Plug Happy: Oh! Oh! Can I be a Pirate too? [pirate hat appears too] Yeah!

Hornet Angry: WHAT!? WHAT ABOUT ME?! [same]

Hornet: FUCK YEAH!!!! [throws the GamePad out of the window]

Galaxy Angry: [gets hit in the head by the Mini GamePad] (x0x) **KOed**

Magma: Arrr! Let's find some lost treasure!!

Plug: Arrr!

Hornet: ARRR!!!

Spike Annoyed: [shakes head no position]

Plug: I don't think Concrete Man likes fun.

Hornet Annoyed: Yeah! What crawled up your ass and died!?

SpikeAloof: ...

Hornet Angry: You know what? EAT THIS!! *shoots out tons of killer bees towards him*

Spike Aloof: [manages to rolls away successfully, but accidentally leaves behind a wishbone he had from a turkey dinner]

Hornet: Dammit!

Hornet Glare: Wait, what the hell did he just dropped?

Plug Happy: Oh, look! A wishbone! We can make a wish by snapping it in half!

Hornet: I want a pet parrot before we get a ship!

Magma Happy: Yar! And I want a pirate ship for me journey!

Plug Scared: But, a wishbone only grants one wish! So, whoever gets the longer piece gets their wish granted!

Hornet Annoyed: Oh what?! Well, I still want my wish!

Magma Happy: And we still need a pirate ship for our crew!

Hornet Glare: Then it's on...!! [grabs the wishbone and holds it up in front of Magma Man]

Magma Annoyed: [grabs the wishbone from the other side]

%Both had a dramatic staredown right before pulling the wishbone to their direction. And... <b>SNAP!!</b>

Magma Giddy: YEAH! [holds the longer piece up]

Hornet Angry: Fuck!

%Suddenly right outside their lawn, the pirate ship appears from thin air in the sky!

Galaxy Shocked: [wakes up and sees a pirate ship dropping onto the pool] (°o°) ... **(°ロ°)!**

Plug Happy: [peeks out the window] Wow, it really worked!!

Magma Happy: [peeks out the window] Yarr!! There it is, lads! All aboard the S.S. Magma!

Hornet Sad: Meh.

%The three goes to board the ship, unknowingly with Galaxy Man curiously trailing behind them.

Plug Shocked: This is bigger than I expected!

Magma Annoyed: Yeah. I think we might need a bigger crew than this.

Hornet Glare: Too bad everyone else preferred Ninjas...

Magma Angry: Well they ain't belonging to our crew for sure!!

Hornet: Exactly!

Galaxy Happy: Hi.

Magma Happy: Ahoy!

Hornet Annoyed: Get lost!

Galaxy: Huh. I just wanted to see what you all are upto...

Hornet: You picked Ninjas! Get out!

Magma: Even if he did, look at it this way. He will realize the errors of his ways and become a true pirate!

Hornet Annoyed: But you just... Ugh. *Fine...*

Magma Happy: Welcome to the crew, Galaxy Man!

Galaxy Happy: Yay!!

Magma Happy: And now with that out of the way, I think we can do with the four of us for now! So it is time to set sail, lads! Arrr!!

Plug Happy: Arr!!

Galaxy Happy: Arr!!

Hornet Annoyed: Arr...

%The pirate ship slowly sails towards out of the pool and drags itself across the land, creating a huge earth-destroying trail behind.
