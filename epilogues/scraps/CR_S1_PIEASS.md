@LOCATIONlightslab: DR. LIGHT'S LAB

Hornet Glare: **[flipping through channels]**<br>Meh. Nothing good is on TV today...

Fake Annoyed: Then stop flipping channels, you've been at it for 30 minutes.

Hornet Glare: **[keeps pressing the button on the remote]**<br>But I'm hoping to catch a good show on! You can just mind your own damned business.

Fake Shocked: But you've cycled through all the channels 5 times...

Hornet Glare: Meh. Still nothing good... **[still flipping]**

Fake Annoyed: Make that 6.

Hornet Glare: Oh, shut it. Not like you have any better ideas.

Fake: ...

Fake Snicker: Well, I've managed to snag a copy of the Nintendo Wii U Classic.

Hornet: ...

Fake Annoyed: ...

Concrete Aloof: ...

Hornet: When did you get in here? Whatever. Not interested anyways.

%Hornet stops channel flipping and ends up at a channel displaying a show called "Super Salmon Ninja Squad".

Hornet Glare: Oh god...

Fake: What's wrong? It's a popular show amongst kids and even adults like us!

Hornet: Well, count me out on being part this stupid trash's braindead audience. Nowadays all the popular shows are about Ninjas. But never pirates. Pirates!!!

Fake: Maybe Pirates are just not the flavor of the mon-

Hornet Angry: WRONG! So so wrong. What do you even know about Pirates? You're not a sheep to the modern mainstream, are you Fakette!? ARE YOU?!

Fake Shocked: Yeesh, taking it a bit personal there. I didn't even stated my preference.

Hornet Glare: So what?! It's personal when Ninjas are somehow the "in" to everyone now. 

Fake Annoyed: They have always been popular, Hornet.

Hornet Angry: FAKETTE, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?! NINJAS ARE TRASH!! **T-R-A-S-H**

%Elsewhere in the Team's base.

Splash: And that is how you-

Splash Shocked: **!!**

Plug Shocked: Sacre bleu, what's wrong?

Splash Nani: I've sensed some serious *dishonor* from the living room...

%Splash Man immediately darts out of his room with Plug Man following.

Hornet Glare: **[watched bits of the show right before deciding to flip channels again]**<br>How do these Salmon even walk? They don't have legs anyways!

Fake Annoyed: It's a cartoon... You're suppose to suspend disbelief!

%Suddenly Splash Man zooms into the scene with Plug Man arriving a few seconds later.

Splash Angry: Alright, who was it?! Who uttered such a dishonorable thing around here?!

Hornet Glare: What are you talkin' about?

Plug Scared: Honestly, I don't know either!!

Fake Snicker: Oh, you mean what Hornet Man had said about Ninjas?

Hornet Glare: Oh yeah. That. They suck, who cares?

Fake Annoyed: But didn't you get all flared up over for...

Hornet Glare: ...

Splash Angry: You dare dishonor our caste?

Hornet: I dare, loser. Pirates are and will always be superior to your dumb little inferior clan.

Splash Nani: ...

Concrete Aloof: ...

Splash Angry: First off, we're not inferior! We hide and strike our foes at the right moment before they know what hit 'em! And second of-

Hornet Glare: **[interrupts]** Wow. So impressive. **NOT!** Sounds like a bunch of miserable cowards in spandexes that jump around like idiots.

Splash Angry: Fool! It's called stealth and there's a lot of work and skills involved, so it's not cowardice you ignorant-

Hornet: Spare me the insults. Pirates are infinitely cooler because they have guns, cannons, and parrots! They also raid islands and villages, then become rich from stealing treasure! Oh and not to mention they fight badass monsters like krakens!

Splash Annoyed: All I'm getting from this is they destroy innocent lives for profit! They have no redeemable qualities whatsoever!

Hornet: Yeah, right! They become rich!

Splash Annoyed: I said *redeemable* qualities. And krakens don't exist you disgraceful idiot!

Hornet Annoyed: What did you say?!

Splash: Face it! Pirates will never be as popular as Ninjas will ever be because they lack honor and dignity! They're just a bunch of corrupt inhumane fools!

Hornet Angry: *Bullshit.* ***BULLSHIT.*** ***B U L L S H I T!***

Splash: Sorry, but it's the truth.

Hornet Annoyed: Well yeah?! Cranch, what do you think?

Plug: Ummm... I was always partial to pir-

Splash Angry: ...

Plug Happy: On second thought!

Hornet Angry: **...**

Plug Annoyed: Uhm... Actually

Splash Nani: **...**

Plug Scared: That is...

Hornet Pissed: <font color="red"><b>...</b></font>

Plug Shocked: **EEK!!** Sorry, my friend but I ch-choose pirates.

Splash: *Sigh*

Hornet Glare: Good.

Galaxy Happy: Hoi! May I chime in to the conversion?

Splash Happy: Yes!

Hornet Glare: No.

Galaxy Happy: Well, personally, I prefer Ninjas. They're so sneaky and cool! They even have these cool little star throwing sharp thingies!

Splash Happy: Good! Glad someone agrees... even with a basic understanding.

Hornet Annoyed: Hmph.

Concrete Aloof: ...

Hornet: ...

Concrete Aloof: ...

Hornet Glare: ...

Splash Annoyed: You know he isn't gonna talk. Don't bother.

Hornet Glare: Yeah, I know.

Fake Happy: Well, personally I prefer Pirate Ninjas!

Hornet: There's no such thing!

Fake Snicker: Yes there is!

Splash Annoyed: Ugh. Fakette, please don't group up Ninjas with such disgraceful and hateful things... 

Fake: I take it you don't get along with Pirates, huh?

Splash Annoyed: I don't want to talk about it.

Hornet: Whatever! This conversation is over!

Splash Annoyed: You just don't wanna admit-

Hornet Glare: Go home!

Splash Angry: Fine! I'm out! **[heads back to his room]**

Galaxy Happy: Well, guess I'm gonna go do some grocery shopping.

Fake: ...But you do this every day. We have so much food already!

Galaxy Annoyed: Huh? You're right but whatever!

%As Galaxy Man heads out to the outdoors, Fakette turns to Hornet wanting to go back to the previous conversation

Fake: So... would you rather talk about the Wii U Classic Mini?

Hornet Glare: But I thought they've stopped at the Gamecube.

Fake Annoyed: Oh no. They've just actually decided to make a Classic Mini Edition of your favorite system.

Hornet Annoyed: Piss off. I've hated it.

Fake: Ya sureee?

Hornet Glare: Yes.

Hornet Annoyed: ...

Hornet: What's in it.

Fake Happy: **[holding a regular Wii U box with a paper taped onto it with written in a marker]**<br>30 amazing games it says!

Hornet Glare: Bullshit. There's only less than half of that.

Fake Snicker: Yeah? I bet you've never heard of Funky Barn!

Hornet: ...How much are you willing to sell it for?

Fake: Uh... $500?

Hornet: **Sold!** **[takes out his wallet and hands over his $500]**

Fake Shocked: O-Oh. Well, I didn't expect an actual sale. Aheh.... **[hands over the box]**

Hornet: Whatever! Hooking it up now! **[opens the box]**

%Suddenly Magma Man barges in from his trip outdoors.

Magma: Guess what!?

Hornet: Shut up! I'm trying to boot up the Wii U Classic Mini!!

Hornet Glare: ...Hmm, the mini system is the exact size as the original...

Magma: I'm now a pirate for no reason! Arrrr!! **[pirate hat and eyepatch suddenly appears]**

Plug Happy: Oh! Oh! Can I be a Pirate too? **[pirate hat appears too]** Yeah!

Hornet Angry: WHAT!? WHAT ABOUT ME?! **[same]**

Hornet: FUCK YEAH!!!! **[throws the GamePad out of the window]**

Galaxy Angry: **[gets hit in the head by the Mini GamePad]** (x0x) **KOed**

Magma: Arrr! Let's find some lost treasure!!

Plug: Arrr!

Hornet: ARRR!!!

Concrete Annoyed: **[shakes head no position]**

Plug: I don't think Concrete Man likes fun.

Hornet Annoyed: Yeah! What crawled up your ass and died!?

Concrete Aloof: ...

Hornet Angry: You know what? EAT THIS!! *shoots out tons of killer bees towards him*

Concrete Aloof: **[manages to rolls away successfully, but accidentally leaves behind a wishbone he had from a turkey dinner]**

Hornet: Dammit!

Hornet Glare: Wait, what the hell did he just dropped?

Plug Happy: Oh, look! A wishbone! We can make a wish by snapping it in half!

Hornet: I want a pet parrot before we get a ship!

Magma Happy: Yar! And I want a pirate ship for me journey!

Plug Scared: But, a wishbone only grants one wish! So, whoever gets the longer piece gets their wish granted!

Hornet Annoyed: Oh what?! Well, I still want my wish!

Magma Happy: And we still need a pirate ship for our crew!

Hornet Glare: Then it's on...!!<br>**[grabs the wishbone and holds it up in front of Magma Man]**

Magma Annoyed: **[grabs the wishbone from the other side]**

%Both had a dramatic staredown right before pulling the wishbone to their direction. And... **SNAP!!**

Magma Giddy: YEAH! **[holds the longer piece up]**

Hornet Angry: Fuck!

%Suddenly right outside their lawn, the pirate ship appears from thin air in the sky!

Galaxy Shocked: **[wakes up and sees a pirate ship dropping onto the pool]**<br>(°o°) ... **(°ロ°)!**

Plug Happy: **[peeks out the window]**<br>Wow, it really worked!!

Magma Happy: **[peeks out the window]**<br>Yarr!! There it is, lads! All aboard the S.S. Magma!

Hornet Sad: Meh.

%The three goes to board the ship, unknowingly with Galaxy Man curiously trailing behind them.

Plug Shocked: This is bigger than I expected!

Magma Annoyed: Yeah. I think we might need a bigger crew than this.

Hornet Glare: Too bad everyone else preferred Ninjas...

Magma Angry: Well they ain't belonging to our crew for sure!!

Hornet: Exactly!

Galaxy Happy: Hi.

Magma Happy: Ahoy!

Hornet Annoyed: Get lost!

Galaxy: Huh. I just wanted to see what you all are up to...

Hornet: You picked Ninjas! Get out!

Magma: Even if he did, look at it this way. He will realize the errors of his ways and become a true pirate!

Hornet Annoyed: But you just... Ugh. *Fine...*

Magma Happy: Welcome to the crew, Galaxy Man!

Galaxy Happy: Yay!!

Magma Happy: And now with that out of the way, I think we can do with the four of us for now! So it is time to set sail, lads! Arrr!!

Plug Happy: Arr!!

Galaxy Happy: Arr!!

Hornet Annoyed: Arr...

%The pirate ship slowly sails towards out of the pool and drags itself across the land, creating a huge earth-destroying trail behind.

%**To be continued...**

@ACTNUM: ACT 2

@LOCATIONocean: <font color="orange">PIRATE SHIP</font>

Magma: Alright, mateys. Listen up! As pirates, ye' all do as I say as I am the captain of the crew. We are gon' get that booty and become rich!

Galaxy Happy: **[snickers]**

Magma Annoyed: Eh?

Galaxy Happy: You said booty and...

Magma Annoyed: Ye think that's funny? Making a fool out yer leader?

Galaxy Shocked: Um...!! 

Magma Angry: I know what job ye scallywag will have now... You shall clean the poop deck whenever it's a mess and do absolutely nothing else! 'less you want to be shark bait...

Galaxy Shocked: (°ロ°)

Galaxy: Wait, why have a *poop* deck when we have a toilet-

Magma Angry: ...

Galaxy: G...Get it? Get the pun?

Magma Angry: ...

Galaxy Shocked: Nevermind...

Hornet: Hey, you chucklefucks! What am I suppose to do?!

Plug: Same.

Magma: Cranchio, you scout on the Crow's Nest and tell us when there's a threat nearby! We can't afford to be unguarded out in the dangerous sea!

Hornet Angry: That was my question!!

Magma: Dunno, do whatever ya want.

Hornet Annoyed: Ugh. I'm going to play the Wii U Classic then.

%Hornet Man then remembers he left the system at home

Hornet Glare: Fuck.

Galaxy: Huh?

%Later... 

Hornet Glare: This is so *boring*. Nothing exciting is even happening.

Galaxy Annoyed: Dude, we've only just started sailing minutes ago.

Hornet Glare: Shut up.

Galaxy Angry: Hey!!

Hornet Annoyed: I said shut up!

Galaxy Pissed: (`д´#)

Hornet Annoyed: Are you trying to scare me? Cause it's not working.

Galaxy Pissed: o(-`д´- ｡)

Hornet Annoyed: Still ain't working!

Galaxy Pissed: щ(ಠ益ಠщ)

Hornet Annoyed: *Still not working!*

Galaxy Angry: (>_<)

Hornet: Wow, you just gave up there.

Galaxy Pissed: THAT'S IT! ＼(｀0´)／ **[takes out a pirate sword and stabs it through Hornet Man's stomach twice]**

Hornet Shocked: HURK!!!

Galaxy Pissed: **[grabs Hornet Man's head and snaps his neck]**

Hornet Shocked: GACK **[spits oil and falls over dead]**

%But that didn't happen.

%*FWOOOSH*

Hornet Glare: What are you staring at?

Galaxy Pissed: ＼(｀0´)／ **[tries stabbing him with the pirate sword but it shatters on impact instead]**

Hornet Annoyed: ...

Galaxy Pissed: **[grabs Hornet Man's head and tries to twist it]**

Hornet Glare: ...

Galaxy Pissed: (ｏ`皿′ｏ)

Hornet Angry: Get off!! **[throws him into a barrel]**

Galaxy Annoyed: *glubglubglub*

%The ship eventually reaches the city of Robotropolis, hitting a filled parking lot.

Plug Scared: **[at the crow's nest]** SACRE BLEU! We're going to hit a bunch of boats!!!!

Hornet: Now we're talking!!

Magma Shocked: **[tries steering the ship]** She's refusin' to turn, lads! Brace for impact!!

%The ship crushes parked cars in its way, all while drivers in their cars drive out of the way for their dear lives. The cars being crushed has their alarms goes off on impact, creating a lot of noise.

Magma Annoyed: I didn't know boats could be so noisy.

Hornet Glare: It's starting to get on my nerves.

Civilian: Hey!! Watch where you're going, jackass!!

Civilian2: GET OFF THE ROAD!!

Civilian3: My car!!! THAT WAS MY CAR!!

Magma Shocked: What was that?

Hornet Glare: 'unno. I guess some seagulls?

Galaxy: *glubglubglub*

Hornet Glare: I told you to shut up!

Galaxy Angry: **[tries to wiggle out of the barrel but to not avail]** *glub...*

Hornet: Ha ha ha ha!!

%Suddenly, police sirens are heard coming from behind the ship's direction.

Plug Annoyed: OH MON DIEU!!

Hornet: Now what?

Plug Scared: This is not good I don't think, but it looks like there's some marines coming our way!

Magma Shocked: T-the Marines?!

Plug Scared: **[using the binoculars and sees the police cars gaining up and eventually getting near the sides of the ship]**<br>Oh non! Ai think they're tryeng to get on ze ship!

Hornet Glare: Okay.

Magma Angry: Let 'em come. Sinistar HUNGERS!

%The police opens the top of their special vehicle, sending out police bots to grapple and climb onto the ship.

Plug Scared: Here they come from both sides!!

Magma: Arrr! **[draws out his sword]** Alright, lads. Hornet, you take care of the right side, I take care of the left. Plug, you scout and let us know of any incoming attacks! And... where is Galaxy?

Galaxy Angry: **[wiggles more and eventually gets the barrel knocked over to the ground]**

Hornet Glare: **[looks at the moving barrel and then shrugs]** Must be inspecting all of the rum or somethin'.

Magma Happy: Ah, good for that lad. Looking out for our ship in such dire times!

Hornet: Yeah, we can take them on ourselves anyways!

Magma Happy: Yer right. Arr! **ATTACK!!!**

Hornet: Arr!!!

%Several groups of police bots makes it to both sides of the ship. Hornet and Magma Man rushes to their assigned sides to fend themselves off from the police bots.

Police Bot 1: We have our target on sight!

%All the police bots on the left side of the ship aims their gun at Magma Man

Magma: Arr, ye ain't going to take me ship and get me treasure, that's one thing for certain! **[aims both of his arm cannon at the police bots]**

Police Bot 2: Uhhh...

Police Bot 3: It appears we're fighting land pirates!

Police Bot 1: Well, we're ready to fire, commander!

Police Commander Bot: **[over at the intercom]** What? Land pirates?! That's just ridiculous! Whatever they are-

%**FWOOOOM**

Police Bots: **AUGHHHH!!!**

Police Commander Bot: **[over at the intercom]** What's going on?! Over!

Police Bot 3: 2 men down! 2 men down! OH NO! 

%**FWOOOOOOOM**

Police Bot 4: EEK!

Magma: Ye'll live. I've only disabled your weapons.

Police Bot 1: You've melted our guns!

Magma: Yes. Like I said-

Police Bot 2: THEY WERE OUR HANDS!!

Magma: Ye shouldn't have messed with me pirate crew and now ye shall pay the price!

Police Bot 3: We got back up! You won't get away with this!!

Hornet: Yo, sup?

**[Magma and the 4 police bots look a large pile of destroyed police bots]**

Police Bot 4: Eep!!

Magma: Aha! Great work there!

Hornet Glare: They were nothing. Can I finish these idiots off? If there's anything I hate more than Galaxy Man are Sea Cops.

Police Bot 1: N-no! We swear we'll do anything!!

Police Bot 4: Please just don't kill us!

Hornet Glare: Hmmmm...

Hornet: Nah!

%Suddenly, a light from above shines on the ship!

Magma Shocked: The heck?!

Hornet Shocked: OW! MY EYES!

Police Bot 2: Back up!

Police Bot 3: We're saved!

%6 more Police Bots parachutes from the helicopter above, all towards the spot where the 4 Police Bots are!

Magma Annoyed: Parachuting marines...?!

Magma Shocked: ...And flying boats?!

Hornet: Oh goody, more carnage! 

Police Bot 5: You're outnumbered!

Hornet Annoyed: Pfft... We've took on more than that and there's still only 10 of you.

Police Bot 6: Who said there were only 10?

Police Bot 7: Yeah!

%Magma Man and Hornet Man looks at the crow's nest where Plug Man, is surrounded by 4 additional Police Guard Bots.

Police Bot 8: If ya want your friend to live, you should surrender!

Police Bot 9: No one messes with the Robotropolis Po-

Plug Angry: **[electricutes all the surrounding Police Guard Bots around him]**

Police Guard Bots: **AIEEEEEEEE!!!!** **[all off the crows nest and smashes on the floor]**

Plug Happy:  **[shrugs]** You can say ze police were in quite a SHOCK.

Hornet: Marines.

Plug Annoyed: What's ze difference?

Police Bot 10: O-oh...

Hornet Glare: Meh. **[grabs a barrel containing Galaxy Man]**

Galaxy: *glub glub?*

Hornet: **[throws the barrel towards the group of 10 bots]**

Galaxy Shocked: *GLUB GLUB???*

Police Bots: Run!

%As they're about to run, the barrel strikes them all out like bowling pins.

Hornet: **Strike!**

Galaxy Shocked: *GLUB GLUBBBBBBB...* **[falls out of the ship]**

Magma Annoyed: What was that weird noise just now?

Hornet Glare: No one important. Let's finish this mess! **[points at the police cars still chasing the ship]**

Magma Angry: Yeah! Let's make sure they don't come back!! **[shoots several wave of magma at the police cars on the road]** 

Hornet: Fuck the marines!! **[sends swarm of bees towards the police cars as well]**

%Several police cars explodes from the magma attack while the rest gets harassed by swarm of bees. The police force eventually loses momentum with the ship and eventually retreats.

Plug Happy: **[looking at the road with the telescope]** Looks like they're all backing off now! We did it!!!!

Magma Happy: Great job, me crew! I'm proud of ye.

%The ship eventually makes its way out of the city and into the fields.

Hornet Sad: Now it's boring again...

Plug Happy: Least we're closer to le treasure now, right?

Magma Happy: **[holding the map]** That we are! Those marines were hardly a challenge either and nothing will stop us from getting our treasure! We will be the greatest pirates that has ever lived!

Hornet Glare: What is the treasure anyways? You've never told us anything about it!

Magma: That's the exciting part! I don't know what's the treasure!

Hornet Angry: What? Are you serious?!

Magma: Yar! I know nothin' about the treasure other than it's right there **[points at an abandoned warehouse on the map]** in ye ol' cove in the middle of the ocean!

Hornet Annoyed: Of all the-

Plug Scared: Eep! **[takes hands off of the telescope and points at the forest]** Wé're abut to cross zé green sea!

Magma: Looks like we're about to cross the unknown territory, lads! Brace yourselves! **[heads back to navigating the ship]**

Hornet Glare: ...
