ACT I

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Living Room</div>

Narrator: It's the night of Christmas Eve... Eve Eve Eve! Which means 4 days before Christmas. Wow! Anyways, just your-**[BOOM]** ...typical day... Yeah.

SplashShocked: [rushing to the living room] What the heck? What just happened??

SpikeAloof: ...

GalaxyScared: [blackened and dizzy from the impact] Uhhh.... ummm... [falls over]

PlugShocked: **Great scott!!** [points towards the Christmas tree] The tree is on fire! Put it out!!

Jewel: [attempts to spray with the fire extinguisher] I can't! There's nothing in it?!

SplashAnnoyed: Dang it! It's been used up for some reason, why?

PlugScared: I don't know, but do something!! The fire is about to spread to the ground!

FakeSnicker: Not to worry! Fakette and her shapeshifting powers to the rescue!

<div class="narration">
Fakette transforms into a huge floating ice bucket of water. She then throws the ice cold water towards the fire right before turning herself back to normal.
</div>

FakeHappy: *Tada~!* All done!

Splash: Uh... Where did the water come from?

FakeSad: My blood. [immediately collaspes]

SplashShocked: **!?**

FakeSnicker: Just kidding! It's really just water.

SplashAnnoyed: ...

SplashAngry: *Right*... Anyways, who have commited such a terrible act? Who would burn the tree?!

GalaxyShocked: It wasn't me!

HornetGlare: A likely story.

<div class="narration">
*AHEM*
</div>

Tornado: Tornde will solve unknown cause.

Splash: Always good to have our resident detective!

GalaxyShocked: ...

Tornado: [walks over to the burnt tree and inspects it] Cause not regular. Top burnt from extreme. Robot Master power possible. [turns back to the team]

GalaxyShocked: **!!**

TornadoAnnoyed: Yes. Reaction. Power was likely space man. [points at Galaxy Man's direction]

JewelAnnoyed: Galaxy Man?! Ugh! I've told you creating a mini nova star would-

SplashAngry: What?! Seriously?! Why on Earth would you create a mini nova.

GalaxySad: I just wanted to make a fancy star for the tree...

HornetAngry: [grabs Galaxy Man] **YOU MORON. DO YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS? SURE THAT WOULD BURNED DOWN THE WHOLE DAMNED HOUSE, BUT THIS MEANS I CAN'T SLEEP ANYMORE. I NEED MY PRECIOUS HOURS OF SLEEP.**

SplashAnnoyed: Uhm...

SpikeAloof: ...

GalaxyShocked: Wait! I'm sorry! Sorry! It won't happen again! You can sleep now!! Don't hurt me, Hornet, please!!

HornetGlare: Meh. 

<div class="narration">
Hornet looks at the charred tree then chucks Galaxy Man towards it.
</div>

HornetGlare: Feh. Now that's taken care of I'm going back to sleep.

SplashAnnoyed: But it's only 5PM.

HornetAnnoyed: Yeah so? I just want to sleep til the Holiday goes by.

FakeAnnoyed: Well, I see someone's not in the holiday spirit.

Hornet: I get nothing but coal every Christmas. What good is coal these days?! USELESS GARBAGE! THAT'S WHAT!

GalaxyDamaged: Well maybe if you weren't such a...

HornetGlare: ...

GalaxyDamaged: Uhm...

HornetGlare: Finish that. I dare you.

SplashAngry: He's right though. Maybe you at least should spend the rest of the holidays being nice!

Hornet: And?
 
Splash: So that way you won't end up on Santa's naughty list?

Hornet: Santa's not real!

Splash: Yes he is!

Hornet: I'm not stupid, Splash Man.

Jewel: He wasn't going to fall for that you know.

SplashAnnoyed: *Sigh*

Plug: [cleaning up the mess from the fire] I think we need a new a new tree...

HornetAnnoyed: [shakes his head] Bah Humbug...

SplashAngry: Oh don't you start that-

HornetGlare: Bah Humbug!!

JewelAnnoyed: Jeez, don't be such a Scrooge!

HornetAngry: **BAH HUMBUG!**

<div class="narration">
Hornet leaves to his room and slams the door shut.
</div>

SplashAnnoyed: This is going to be a long night...

Fake: [to self] ...Should we? Hmmm...

SplashAnnoyed: What? Give him more presents full of coal?

FakeAnnoyed: Well no. Jewel's comment gave me an idea actually!

PlugHappy: Oh! Do tell!

FakeAnnoyed: Why don't we dress up as the three Ghosts of Christmas and teach him the holiday spirit?

Splash: That's never going to work. He'll just end up being annoyed!

FakeSnicker: Exactly!

SplashAnnoyed: ...

PlugAnnoyed: ...

SplashHappy: I'm in!

Plug: Same I guess.

GalaxyRelieved: Oh! Me too! Me too!

FakeSnicker: Great! So that's the four of us. This is going to be *so fun*.

ACT II
</h1></center></div>

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Living Room</div>

<div class="narration">
Magma Man appears into the scene by sliding down the stairway's rails and with his feet and does a double flip jump at the end of the rail then lands perfectly onto the living room floor.
</div>

TornadoHappy: [holds up a "10" card]

JewelHappy: [holds up a "10" card as well]

SpikeAloof: [holds up a blank card] ...

MagmaAnnoyed: Oh come on! You're even too lazy to write a number, Concrete?! Where is your Sinimas Spirit?

Jewel: What's a Sinimas?

MagmaHappy: Only the best holiday ever conceived in Sinistar-kind!

TornadoAnnoyed: What?

MagmaAnnoyed: Don't tell me you've never heard of Sinimas!

TornadoAnnoyed: Confusion. We want Sinimas knowledge to be acquired.

MagmaHappy: It's a wonderful time where all the Sinistars come together and celebrate a festive day by eating space ships!

Jewel: ...

TornadoAnnoyed: ...

MagmaAnnoyed: What?

Jewel: I thought Sinistar was just one entity. Plus, there's several holidays this month but I'm certain Sinimas is not one of them!

MagmaHappy: Well, there should be if there isn't one on this planet! It's time to change things up. Sinimas isn't going to start itself! To the North Pole!

JewelShocked: North Pole?!

MagmaGiddy: That's right! I'm going to replace Christmas. What better way to introduce the world to Sinimas than replacing one of the biggest holidays of the country?! Ol' St. Nicholas is gonna have a brand new PR for his holiday brand! Me!

JewelAnnoyed: Um, have fun with that I guess.

MagmaGiddy: YEAnarration!!!

<div class="narration">
Magma Man dashes outside, gets in a flying vehicle and flies away.
</div>

TornadoAnnoyed: Still confusion. But also concern.

JewelAnnoyed: Wait, did he just took Dr. Light's flying car?

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Hornet Man's Bedroom</div>

HornetSleep: Zzzz... Zzzzzzzzz........

GhostPast: Heheheh...

GhostPast: BOO!

HornetShocked: [immediately wakes up and sits up on his bed] AUGH! What the?! [turns to the ghost] ...

GhostPast: ...

HornetGlare: Who the hell are you?

GhostPast: Hornet Mannnnnnnn... I am your Ghost of the Christmas Past...

Hornet: ...

HornetGlare: So?

GhostPast: We exist because of your misdeeds and poor character, past and presentttt... We the three ghosts have been chosen to warn to you of an uncertain fate from the dark path you've chosen in your entire lifeeee...

HornetGlare: Really? Then where's the other ghosts?

GhostPast: They will arrive laterrrr, one by oneeee....

HornetAnnoyed: Do you think I actually care?

GhostPast: No.

HornetGlare: Then stop bugging me. You're just an annoying candle, so just go away before I'll show you a misdeed. And cut it out with your ghostly act, dumbass.

GhostPast: But wouldn't you at least like to revisit your past? It's right out of this door!

HornetAnnoyed: You know what? Fine.

GhostPast: Follow me! [bumps into the door] Ooof! Uh, can you open the door? I have no hands...

<div class="narration">
Hornet Man gets out of the bed and walks towards the door to open it. He then sees Splash Man who is just wearing a shoddy outfit representing Hornet Man from the past.
</div>

HornetAnnoyed: Hello, past me.

PastHornet: !

HornetGlare: Psst, never join Cyborg Resistance when you're older. Or you'd be dealing with a major headache from a UFO.

GhostPast: He can't see or hear you. You're only experiencing old memories.

Hornet: What? But he just looked at me!

GhostPast: He's not! [looks back at Splash Man and gives a glare] It was just well timed he looked at your direction is all!

HornetGlare: Lame. I wanna go back to my room then.

GhostPast: But you've just got here!

Hornet: Fine! [looks at Splash Man]

PastHornet: My name is Hornet Man and I smell really bad!

HornetGlare: ...Hmmm...

GalaxyAnnoyed: [behind a prop] **ahem** [quietly to Splash Man] You're ruining it.

PastHornetAnnoyed: Oh! Ha ha ha My name is Hornet Man and I am 5 years old and I am mean!! [lazily smashes a bunch of empty xmas boxes]

GhostPast: So... uh... Do you get it now?

Hornet: Yeah, I just need to take care of my personal hygene more.

GhostPast: Erm...

Hornet: Look, I honestly don't know what else is wrong here. And well, it's been fun but I want to *sleep* right now.

GhostPast: Really? Nothing wrong here?

HornetGlare: Yes and you're just wasting my time at this point. So just go away!

<div class="narration">
Hornet Man walks back towards his room and rests in his bed again.
</div>

GhostPast: ...

PastHornet: What?

GalaxyAnnoyed: I can't tell if we're suppose to annoy or actually help him.

GhostPast: Well I gotta pretend to care and be in character!

PlugAnnoyed: [gets out of the big fake present box] I guess it's my turn.

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Somewhere in a frozen desert.</div>

MagmaAnnoyed: [gets out of the frozen vehicle's wreckage] Curses! No one told me the North Pole was going to be that cold!

MagmaGiddy: Doesn't matter! I am certain the workshop is not too far from here!!

Chill: Hey, man.

MagmaAnnoyed: Eh? Who may you be?

Chill: Just a forgotten member of an old defunct team... Never recognized and always missing in action.

MagmaSad: Oh, I'm sorry.

Chill: Haha, nah. I don't care. I was so lazy and was never there anyways. I'm just really... chill, man.
