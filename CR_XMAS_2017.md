Narrator: It's the night of Christmas Eve... Eve Eve Eve! Which means 4 days before Christmas. Wow! Anyways, just your-**[BOOM]** ...typical day... Yeah.

SplashShocked: [rushing to the living room] What the heck? What just happened??

SpikeAloof: ...

GalaxyScared: [blackened and dizzy from the impact] Uhhh.... ummm... [falls over]

PlugShocked: **Great scott!!** [points towards the Christmas tree] The tree is on fire! Put it out!!

Jewel: [attempts to spray with the fire extinguisher] I can't! There's nothing in it?!

SplashAnnoyed: Dang it! It's been used up for some reason, why?

PlugScared: I don't know, but do something!! The fire is about to spread to the ground!

FakeSnicker: Not to worry! Fakette and her shapeshifting powers to the rescue!

<div class="hhhh">
Fakette transforms into a huge floating ice bucket of water. She then throws the ice cold water towards the fire right before turning herself back to normal.
</div>

FakeHappy: *Tada~!* All done!

Splash: Uh... Where did the water come from?

FakeSad: My blood. [immediately collaspes]

SplashShocked: **!?**

FakeSnicker: Just kidding! It's really just water.

SplashAnnoyed: ...

SplashAngry: *Right*... Anyways, who have commited such a terrible act? Who would burn the tree?!

GalaxyShocked: It wasn't me!

HornetGlare: A likely story.

<div class="hhhh">
*AHEM*

Tornado: Tornde will solve unknown cause.

Splash: Always good to have our resident detective!

GalaxyShocked: ...

Tornado: [walks over to the burnt tree and inspects it] Cause not regular. Robot Master power possible. [turns back to the team]

GalaxyShocked: **!!**

TornadoAnnoyed: Yes. Reaction. Power was likely space man. [points at Galaxy Man's direction]

JewelAnnoyed: Galaxy Man?! Ugh! I've tried to tell you creating a mini nova star would-

SplashAngry: What?! Seriously?! Why on Earth would you create a mini nova.

GalaxySad: I just wanted to make a fancy star for the tree...

HornetAngry: [grabs Galaxy Man] **YOU MORON. DO YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS? SURE THAT WOULD BURNED DOWN THE WHOLE DAMNED HOUSE, BUT THIS MEANS I CAN'T SLEEP ANYMORE. I NEED MY PRECIOUS HOURS OF SLEEP.**

SplashAnnoyed: Uhm...

SpikeAloof: ...

GalaxyShocked: Wait! I'm sorry! Sorry! It won't happen again! You can sleep now!! Don't hurt me, Hornet, please!!

HornetGlare: Meh. 

<div class="hhhh">
Hornet looks at the charred tree then chucks Galaxy Man towards it.
</div>

HornetGlare: Feh. Now that's taken care of I'm going back to sleep.

SplashAnnoyed: But it's only 5PM.

HornetAnnoyed: Yeah so? I just want to sleep til the Holiday goes by.

FakeAnnoyed: Well, I see someone's not in the holiday spirit.

Hornet: I get nothing but coal every Christmas. What good is coal these days?! USELESS GARBAGE! THAT'S WHAT!

GalaxyDamaged: Well maybe if you weren't such a...

HornetGlare: ...

GalaxyDamaged: Uhm...

HornetGlare: Finish that. I dare you.

SplashAngry: He's right though. Maybe you at least should spend the rest of the holidays being nice!

Hornet: And?
 
Splash: So that way you won't end up on Santa's naughty list?

Hornet: Santa's not real!

Splash: Yes he is!

Hornet: I'm not stupid, Splash Man.

Jewel: He wasn't going to fall for that you know.

SplashAnnoyed: *Sigh*

Plug: [cleaning up the mess from the fire] I think we need a new a new tree...

HornetAnnoyed: [shakes his head] Bah Humbug...

SplashAngry: Oh don't you start that-

HornetGlare: Bah Humbug!!

JewelAnnoyed: Jeez, don't be such a Scrooge!

HornetAngry: **BAH HUMBUG!**

<div class="hhhh">
Hornet leaves to his room and slams the door shut.
</div>

SplashAnnoyed: This is going to be a long night...

Fake: [to self] ...Should we? Hmmm...

SplashAnnoyed: What? Give him more presents full of coal?

FakeAnnoyed: Well no. Jewel's comment gave me an idea actually!

PlugHappy: Oh! Do tell!

FakeAnnoyed: Why don't we dress up as the three Ghosts of Christmas and teach him the holiday spirit?

Splash: That's never going to work. He'll just end up being annoyed!

FakeSnicker: Exactly!
