**LOCATION:** Team Base

HornetGlare: [flipping through channels] Fuckin' nothing good is on TV today...

FakeAnnoyed: Then stop flipping channels, you've been at it for 30 minutes.

HornetGlare: [keeps pressing the button on the remote] But I'm hoping to catch a fuckin' good show on. You can just mind your own damned business.

FakeShocked: But you've cycled through all the channels 5 times...

HornetGlare: Meh. [still flipping]

FakeAnnoyed: Make that 6.

HornetGlare: Ah, shut it. Not like you have any better ideas.

Fake: ...

FakeSnicker: Well, I've managed to snag a copy of the Nintendo Wii U Classic.

Hornet: ...

FakeAnnoyed: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

Hornet: When did you get in here? Whatever. Not interested anyways.

[Hornet stops channel flipping and it eventually stops at a show called "Super Salmon Ninja Squad".]

HornetGlare: Oh god...

Fake: What's wrong? It's a popular show amongst kids and even adults like us!

Hornet: Well, count me out on being part this stupid trash's braindead audience. Nowadays all the popular shows are about Ninjas, Samurais and whatever else. But never pirates. Pirates!!!

Fake: Maybe Pirates are just not the appeal-

HornetAngry: BULLSHIT! PIRATES DO HAVE APPEAL BECAUSE PIRATES ARE BADASS! FUCK NINJAS.

[Elsewhere in the Team's base]

Splash: And that is how you-

SplashShocked: **!!**

PlugShocked: Sacre bleu, what's wrong?

SplashNani: I've sensed some serious *dishonor* from the living room...

[Splash Man immediately darts out of his room with Plug Man following.]

HornetGlare: [watched bits of the show right before deciding to flip channels again] How do these Salmon even walk? They don't have legs anyways!

FakeAnnoyed: It's a cartoon... You're suppose to suspend belief!

[Suddenly Splash Man zooms into the scene with Plug Man arriving a few seconds later]

SplashAngry: Alright, who was it?! Who uttered such a dishonorable thing around here?!

HornetGlare: What are you talkin' about?

PlugScared: Honestly, I don't know either!!

FakeSnicker: Oh, you mean what Hornet Man had said about Ninjas?

HornetGlare: Oh yeah. That. They suck, who cares. Move on.

SplashAngry: You dare dishonor my clan?

Hornet: Piss off, loser. Pirates are and will always be superior to your dumb little cowardly clan.

SplashNani: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

SplashAngry: First off, we're not cowards. We hide and strike at the right moment, killing our foes before they know what hit 'em! And second of-

HornetGlare: [interrupts] Wow. So impressive. **NOT!** Sounds like a bunch of miserable cowards in spandexes that jump around like idiots.

SplashAngry: That's not cowardice! It's called stealth and it's a lot of effort to put into it, you ignorant-

Hornet: Spare me the insults. Pirates are infinitely cooler because they have guns, cannons, and parrots! They also raid islands and villages, then become rich from stealing treasure! Oh and not to mention they fight badass monsters like krakens!

SplashAnnoyed: ...There is no such thing as krakens. Also going by your description of pirates, they unsuprisingly sound like a bunch of dishonorable jerks with no redeemable qualities whatsoever.

Hornet: Yeah, right! They become rich too!

SplashAnnoyed: I said *redeemable* qualities.

HornetAnnoyed: What did you say?!

Splash: Face it. Ninjas are more better for a reason! Pirates will never be as popular as Ninjas will ever be because they lack honor and dignity! They're just a bunch of corrupt fools that only want their own gain!

HornetAngry: *Bullshit.* **BULLSHIT.** ***B U L L S H I T!***

Splash: Sorry, but it's the truth.

HornetAnnoyed: Well yeah?! Cranch, what do you think?

Plug: Ummm... I was always partial to pir-

SplashAngry: ...

PlugHappy: On second thought!

HornetAngry: **...**

PlugAnnoyed: Uhm... Actually

SplashNani: **...**

PlugScared: That is...

HornetPissed: <font color="red"><b>...</b></font>

PlugShocked: **EEK!!** Sorry, my friend but I ch-choose pirates.

Splash: *Sigh*

HornetGlare: Good.

GalaxyHappy: Hoi! May I chime in to the conversion?

SplashHappy: Yes!

HornetGlare: No.

GalaxyHappy: Well, personally, I prefer Ninjas. They're so stealthy and cool! They even have these cool little star throwing sharp thingies!

SplashHappy: Good! Glad someone agrees.

HornetAnnoyed: Hmph.

ConcreteAloof: ...

Hornet: ...

ConcreteAloof: ...

HornetGlare: ...

SplashAnnoyed: You know he isn't gonna talk. Don't bother.

HornetGlare: Yeah, I know.

FakeHappy: Well, personally I prefer Pirate Ninjas!

Hornet: There's no such thing!

FakeSnicker: Yes there is!

SplashAnnoyed: Ugh. Fakette, please don't group up Ninjas with such disgraceful and hateful things... 

Fake: I take it you don't get along with Pirates, huh?

SplashAnnoyed: I don't want to talk about it.

Hornet: Whatever! This conversation is over!

SplashAngry: Fine! I'm out! [heads back to his room]

GalaxyHappy: Well, guess I'm gonna go grocery shopping! [walks out the door]

Fake: ...But you do this every day. We have so much food already!

GalaxyAnnoyed: Huh? You're right but whatever!

[As Galaxy Man heads out to the outdoors, Fakette turns to Hornet wanting to go back to the previous conversation]

Fake: So... would you rather talk about the Wii U Classic Mini?

HornetGlare: But I thought they've stopped at the Gamecube.

FakeAnnoyed: Oh no. They've just actually decided to make a Classic Mini Edition of your favorite system.

HornetAnnoyed: Piss off. I've hated it.

Fake: Ya sureee?

HornetGlare: Yes.

HornetAnnoyed: ...

Hornet: What's in it.

FakeHappy: [holding a regular Wii U box with a paper taped onto it with written in a marker] 30 amazing games it says!

HornetGlare: Bullshit. There's only less than half of that.

FakeSnicker: Yeah? I bet you've never heard of Funky Barn!

Hornet: ...How much are you willing to sell it for?

Fake: Uh... $500?

Hornet: **Sold!** [takes out his wallet and hands over his $500]

FakeShocked: O-Oh. Well, I didn't expect an actual sale. Aheh.... [hands over the box]

Hornet: Whatever! Hooking it up now! [opens the box]

[Suddenly Magma Man barges in from his trip outdoors.]

Magma: Guess what!?

Hornet: Shut up! I'm trying to boot up the Wii U Classic Mini!!

HornetGlare: ...Hmm, the size of the system doesn't look small...

Magma: I'm now a pirate for no reason! Arrrr!! [pirate hat and eyepatch suddenly appears]

PlugHappy: Oh! Oh! Can I be a Pirate too? [pirate hat appears too] Yeah!

HornetAngry: WHAT!? WHAT ABOUT ME?! [same]

Hornet: FUCK YEAH!!!! [throws the GamePad out of the window]

GalaxyAngry: [gets hit in the head by the Mini GamePad] (x0x) **KOed**

Magma: Arrr! Let's find some lost treasure!!

Plug: Arrr!

Hornet: ARRR!!!

ConcreteAnnoyed: [shakes head no position]

Plug: I don't think Concrete Man likes fun.

HornetAnnoyed: Yeah! What crawled up your ass and died!?

ConcreteAloof: ...

HornetAngry: You know what? EAT THIS!! *shoots out tons of killer bees towards him*

ConcreteAloof: [manages to rolls away successfully, but accidentally leaves behind a wishbone he had from a turkey dinner]

Hornet: Dammit!

PlugHappy: Oh, look! A wishbone! We can make a wish by breaking it into two!

Hornet: I want a pet parrot before we get a ship!

MagmaHappy: Yeah?! Well we still need a pirate ship!!

[Hornet Man and Magma Man hold the wishbone and snap it in half. Fortunately for Magma Man, he got the longer piece to grant his wish.]

Hornet: Fuck.

[The pirate ship suddenly appears outside]

GalaxyShocked: [wakes up and sees a pirate ship dropping onto the pool] (°o°) ... **(°ロ°)!**

MagmaGiddy: Arrr, there it is, lads! All aboard the S.S. Magma!

HornetAngry: Dammit! I hope I get a pet parrot on our way then!

Magma: You can get both a parrot and treasure in one journey you know! I bet there's plenty of both at the destination!

Hornet: I guess.

[The three goes to board the ship, unknowingly with Galaxy Man curiously trailing behind them.]

PlugHappy: This is bigger than I expected!

MagmaAnnoyed: Yeah. I think we might need a bigger crew than this.

HornetGlare: Too bad everyone else preferred Ninjas...

MagmaAngry: Well they ain't belonging to our crew for sure!!

Hornet: Exactly!

GalaxyHappy: Hi.

Magma: Ahoy!

HornetAngry: Get lost! You've picked Ninja!

Galaxy: Huh. I just wanted to see what you all are upto...

Magma: Even if he did, look at it this way. He will realize the errors of his ways and become a true pirate!

HornetAnnoyed: Ughhhh... *Fine...* But listen here, you better not do anything funny... Or else.

MagmaHappy: Welcome to the crew, Galaxy Man! I think we can do with four to set sail. Arr! Time to set sail, lads!

(The pirate ship slowly sails towards out of the pool and drags across the land, creating a huge grass-destroying path behind.)

Magma: Alright, mateys. Listen up! As pirates, ye' all do as I say as I am the captain of the crew. We are gon' get that booty and become rich!

GalaxyHappy: [snickers]

MagmaAnnoyed: Eh?

GalaxyHappy: You said booty and... oh...

MagmaAngry: I know what job ye scallywag will have now... You shall clean the poop deck whenever it's a mess and do absolutely nothing else! 'less you want to be shark bait...

GalaxyShocked: (°ロ°)

Galaxy: Wait, if I have to clean the *poop* deck while it's dirty, doesn't this mean I always have to clean it because-

MagmaAngry: ...

GalaxyShocked: Heh. Heh. Get it? Because... poo...

MagmaAngry: ...

Hornet: Hey, you chucklefucks! What am I suppose to do?!

Plug: Same.

Magma: Cranchio, you scout on the Crow's Nest and tell us when there's a threat nearby! We can't afford to be unguarded out in the dangerous sea!

HornetAngry: HEY! I SAID WHAT ABOUT ME?!

Magma: Dunno, do whatever ya want.

HornetAnnoyed: Ugh. I'm going to play the Wii U Classic then.

[Hornet Man then remembers he left the system at home]

HornetGlare: Fuck.

**LOCATION:** Pirate Ship

Narrator: The crew's pirate ship set sail for a grand adventure across the sea, er, I mean land? Umm...

[The ship somehow slowly grates across the land, leaving behind a huge path of destroyed ground.]

Narrator: Yeah, land. I guess.

HornetGlare: ...

Galaxy: ?

HornetGlare: Wow. This is so *boring*. Nothing exciting is even happening.

GalaxyAnnoyed: Dude, we've only just started sailing 3 minutes ago.

Hornet: Oh, shut your stupid annoying face.

GalaxyAngry: Hey!!

HornetAnnoyed: I said shut up!

GalaxyPissed: (`д´#)

HornetAnnoyed: Are you trying to scare me? Cuz' it ain't working motha fucka.

GalaxyPissed: o(-`д´- ｡)

HornetAnnoyed: Still ain't working!

GalaxyPissed: щ(ಠ益ಠщ)

HornetAnnoyed: STILL NOT WORKING!!!!!!

GalaxyAngry: (>_<)

HornetGlare: Wow, you've just given up there ya sack of shit.

GalaxyPissed: THAT'S IT! ＼(｀0´)／ [takes out a pirate sword and stabs it through Hornet Man's stomach twice]

HornetShocked: HURK!!!

GalaxyPissed: [grabs Hornet Man's head and twists it to snap his neck]

HornetShocked: GACK [falls over dead]

(That didn't happen)

*FWOOOSH*

Hornet: Well...?

GalaxyPissed: ＼(｀0´)／ [tries stabbing him with the pirate sword but it shatters on impact instead]

HornetAnnoyed: ...

GalaxyPissed: [grabs Hornet Man's head and tries to twist it]

HornetGlare: ...

GalaxyPissed: (ｏ`皿′ｏ)

Hornet: Get off!! [throws him into a barrel]

GalaxyAnnoyed: *glubglubglub*

[The ship eventually reaches the city of Robotropolis, hitting the full parking lot.]

PlugScared: [at the crow's nest] SACRE BLEU! We're going to hit a bunch of boats!!!!

Hornet: Now we're talking!!

MagmaShocked: [tries steering the ship] She's refusin' to turn, lads! Brace for impact!!

[The ship crushes parked cars in its way, all while drivers in their cars drive out of the way for their dear lives. The cars being crushed has their alarms goes off on impact, creating a lot of noise.]

MagmaAnnoyed: I didn't know boats could be so noisy.

HornetGlare: It's starting to get on my nerves.

Civilian: Hey!! Watch where you're going, jackass!!

Civilian2: GET OFF THE ROAD!!

Civilian3: My car!!! THAT WAS MY CAR!!

MagmaShocked: What was that?

HornetGlare: 'unno. I guess some really chatty seagulls?

Galaxy: *glubglubglub*

Hornet: I told ya to shut up!

GalaxyAngry: [tries to wiggle out of the barrel but to not avail] *glub...*

Hornet: Ha ha ha ha!!

[Suddenly, police sirens are heard coming from behind the ship's direction.]

PlugAnnoyed: OH MON DIEU!!

Hornet: Now what?

PlugScared: This is not good I don't think, but it looks like there's rival pirate boats coming our way!

MagmaAnnoyed: Weird! Why would they use boats?

PlugScared: [using the binoculars and sees the police cars gaining up and eventually getting near the sides of the ship] Oh no!!! I think they're trying to get on the ship!

HornetGlare: Okay.

MagmaAngry: Let 'em come. Sinistar HUNGERS!

[The police opens the top of their special vehicle, sending out police bots to grapple and climb onto the ship.]

PlugScared: Here they come from both sides!!

Magma: Arrr! [draws out his sword] Alright, lads. Hornet, you take care of the right side, I take care of the left. Plug, you scout and let us know of any incoming attacks! And... where is Galaxy?

GalaxyAngry: [wiggles more and eventually gets the barrel knocked over to the ground]

HornetGlare: [looks at the moving barrel and then shrugs] Must be cleaning hall inside or somethin'.

MagmaAngry: Ah, good for that lad. Looking out for our ship in such dire times!

Hornet: Yeah, we can take them on ourseives anyways!

MagmaHappy: Yer right. Arr!

Hornet: Arr!!!

[Several groups of police bots makes it to both sides of the ship. Hornet and Magma Man rushes to their assigned sides to fend themselves off from the police bots.]

Police Bot 1: We're on the ship and the targets are in our sights.

[All the police bots on the left side of the ship aims their gun at Magma Man]

Magma: Arr, ye ain't going to steal my ship and get my treasure! That's one thing for certain! [aims both of his arm cannon at the police bots]

Police Bot 2: Uhhh...

Police Bot 3: It appears we're fighting land pirates!

Police Bot 1: We're ready to fire, commander!

Police Commander Bot: [over at the intercom] What? Land pirates?! That's just ridiculous! Whatever they are-

**FWOOOOM**

Police Bots: AUGHHHH!!!

Police Commander Bot: [over at the intercom] What's going on?! Over!

Police Bot 3: 2 men down! 2 men down! OH NO! 

**FWOOOOOOOM**

Police Bot 4: EEK!

Magma: Ye'll live. I've only disabled your weapons.

Police Bot 1: You've melted our guns!

Magma: Yes. Like I said-

Police Bot 2: THEY WERE OUR HANDS!!

Magma: Ye shouldn't have messed with me pirate crew and now ye shall pay the price!

Police Bot 3: There's more than the 4 of us here! You won't get away with this!!

Hornet: Yo, sup?

[Magma and the 4 police bots look a large pile of destroyed police bots]

Police Bot 4: Eep!!

Magma: Aha! Great work there!

HornetGlare: They were nothing. Can I finish these idiots off?

Police Bot 1: N-no! We swear we'll do anything!!

Police Bot 4: Please just don't kill us!

Hornet: Hmmmm... Nah!

[Suddenly, a light from above shines on the ship]

MagmaShocked: The heck?!

HornetShocked: OW! MY EYES!

Police Bot 2: Back up!

Police Bot 3: We're saved!

[6 more Police Bots parachutes from the helicopter above, all towards the spot where the 4 Police Bots are]

MagmaAnnoyed: Parachuting pirates...?!

Hornet: Oh goody, more carnage! 

Police Bot 5: You're outnumbered! 10 to 3!

HornetAnnoyed: Are you blind or are you stupid? Or both? We've took on larger numbers than 10, plus the 4 of your pals are already disarmed so that makes it 6 you stupid idiot!

Police Bot 6: Who's to say we aren't counting the 4 on the crow's nest?

Police Bot 7: Yeah!

[Magma Man and Hornet Man looks at the crow's nest where Plug Man, is surrounded by 4 Police Guard Bots.]

Police Bot 8: If ya want your friend to get out of this alive, you should surrender!

Police Bot 9: No one can beat the Robotropolis Po-

PlugAngry: [electricutes all the surrounding Police Guard Bots around him]

Police Guard Bots: AIEEEEEEEE!!!! [alls off the crows nest and smashes on the floor]

PlugHappy: You can say these pirates were in quite a SHOCK, mon amis. [shrugs]

Police Bot 10: O-oh...

HornetGlare: Meh. [grabs a barrel]

Galaxy: *glub glub?*

Hornet: [throws the barrel towards the group of 10 bots]

GalaxyShocked: *GLUB GLUB???*

Police Bots: Yikes!

[As they're about to run, the barrel strikes them all out like bowling pins]

GalaxyShocked: *GLUB GLUBBBBBBB...* [falls out of the ship]

Hornet: **Strike!**

MagmaAnnoyed: Did you hear that weird noise?

HornetGlare: Nah. But let's finish this mess! [points at the police cars still chasing the ship]

MagmaAngry: Yeah! Let's make surae they don't come back!! [shoots several wave of magma at the police cars on the road] 

Hornet: Yeah, destroy them all!! Hmhmhmhmhmhmhm!!! [sends swarm of bees towards the police cars as well]

[Several police cars explodes from the magma attack while the rest gets harassed by swarm of bees. The police force eventually loses momentum with the ship and eventually retreats.]

PlugHappy: [looking at the road with the binoculars] Looks like they're all backing off now! We did it!!!!

MagmaHappy: Great job there, crew!

Hornet: Ya but now it's boring again! FUCK!

MagmaHappy: [holding the map] Was hardly a challenge either! Nothing will stop us from getting our treasure! Yarr!! We will be the greatest pirates that has ever lived!

HornetGlare: What is the treasure anyways? You've never told us what's in it!

Magma: That's the exciting part! I don't know what's in it!

Hornet: What? Are you serious?!

Magma: Ya

HornetAnnoyed: How do we know if it's treasure then?!

Magma: For one, the map did say Treasure, but we don't know what's exactly in it! Look at it this way, if there's real treasure we hit the jackpot! But if it's a trap, then it's another exciting fight for our survival! Yarr!!! 

HornetGlare: What a fucking waste of time then!! Where did you even get this rubbish map?

Magma: The internet! I was looking at Moogle Earth and found out there's something in the great Robotropolis Sea called "Treasure Warehouse". There has to be treasure I tell you!! 

HornetGlare: ... What is wrong with you?!

MagmaAnnoyed: What?

HornetAngry: ...
