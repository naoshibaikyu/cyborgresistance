<p>HornetGlare: [flipping through channels] Meh. Nothing good is on TV today…</p>

<p>FakeAnnoyed: Then stop flipping channels, you’ve been at it for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: [keeps pressing the button on the remote] But I’m hoping to catch a good show on! You can just mind your own damned business.</p>

<p>FakeShocked: But you’ve cycled through all the channels 5 times…</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Meh. Still nothing good… [still flipping]</p>

<p>FakeAnnoyed: Make that 6.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Oh, shut it. Not like you have any better ideas.</p>

<p>Fake: …</p>

<p>FakeSnicker: Well, I’ve managed to snag a copy of the Nintendo Wii U Classic.</p>

<p>Hornet: …</p>

<p>FakeAnnoyed: …</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: …</p>

<p>Hornet: When did you get in here? Whatever. Not interested anyways.</p>

<div class="hhhh">Hornet stops channel flipping and ends up at a channel displaying a show called "Super Salmon Ninja Squad".</div>

<p>HornetGlare: Oh god…</p>

<p>Fake: What’s wrong? It’s a popular show amongst kids and even adults like us!</p>

<p>Hornet: Well, count me out on being part this stupid trash’s braindead audience. Nowadays all the popular shows are about Ninjas, Samurais and whatever else. But never pirates. Pirates!!!</p>

<p>Fake: Maybe Pirates are just not appealing to-</p>

<p>HornetAngry: WRONG! So so wrong. What do you even know about Pirates? You’re not a sheep to the modern mainstream, are you Fakette!? ARE YOU?!</p>

<p>FakeShocked: Yeesh, taking it a bit personal there. I didn’t even stated my perference.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: So?! It’s personal when Ninjas are somehow the “in” to everyone now.</p>

<p>FakeAnnoyed: They have always been popular, Hornet.</p>

<p>HornetAngry: FAKETTE, DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND?! NINJAS ARE TRASH!! <strong>T-R-A-S-H</strong></p>

<div class="hhhh">Elsewhere in the Team's base.</div>

<p>Splash: And that is how you-</p>

<p>SplashShocked: <strong>!!</strong></p>

<p>PlugShocked: Sacre bleu, what’s wrong?</p>

<p>SplashNani: I’ve sensed some serious <em>dishonor</em> from the living room…</p>

<div class="hhhh">Splash Man immediately darts out of his room with Plug Man following.</div>

<p>HornetGlare: [watched bits of the show right before deciding to flip channels again] How do these Salmon even walk? They don’t have legs anyways!</p>

<p>FakeAnnoyed: It’s a cartoon… You’re suppose to suspend disbelief!</p>

<div class="hhhh">Suddenly Splash Man zooms into the scene with Plug Man arriving a few seconds later.</div>

<p>SplashAngry: Alright, who was it?! Who uttered such a dishonorable thing around here?!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: What are you talkin’ about?</p>

<p>PlugScared: Honestly, I don’t know either!!</p>

<p>FakeSnicker: Oh, you mean what Hornet Man had said about Ninjas?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Oh yeah. That. They suck, who cares?</p>

<p>FakeAnnoyed: But didn’t you get all flared up over for…</p>

<p>HornetGlare: …</p>

<p>SplashAngry: You dare dishonor our caste?</p>

<p>Hornet: I dare, loser. Pirates are and will always be superior to your dumb little inferior clan.</p>

<p>SplashNani: …</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: …</p>

<p>SplashAngry: First off, we’re not inferior! We hide and strike our foes at the right moment before they know what hit ‘em! And second of-</p>

<p>HornetGlare: [interrupts] Wow. So impressive. <strong>NOT!</strong> Sounds like a bunch of miserable cowards in spandexes that jump around like idiots.</p>

<p>SplashAngry: Fool! It’s called stealth and there’s a lot of work and skills involved, so it’s not cowardice you ignorant-</p>

<p>Hornet: Spare me the insults. Pirates are infinitely cooler because they have guns, cannons, and parrots! They also raid islands and villages, then become rich from stealing treasure! Oh and not to mention they fight badass monsters like krakens!</p>

<p>SplashAnnoyed: All I’m getting from this is they destroy innocent lives for profit! They have no redeemable qualities whatsoever!</p>

<p>Hornet: Yeah, right! They become rich!</p>

<p>SplashAnnoyed: I said <em>redeemable</em> qualities. And krakens don’t exist you disgraceful idiot!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: What did you say?!</p>

<p>Splash: Face it! Pirates will never be as popular as Ninjas will ever be because they lack honor and dignity! They’re just a bunch of corrupt inhumane fools!</p>

<p>HornetAngry: <em>Bullshit.</em> <strong><em>BULLSHIT.</em></strong> <strong><em>B U L L S H I T!</em></strong></p>

<p>Splash: Sorry, but it’s the truth.</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Well yeah?! Cranch, what do you think?</p>

<p>Plug: Ummm… I was always partial to pir-</p>

<p>SplashAngry: …</p>

<p>PlugHappy: On second thought!</p>

<p>HornetAngry: <strong>…</strong></p>

<p>PlugAnnoyed: Uhm… Actually</p>

<p>SplashNani: <strong>…</strong></p>

<p>PlugScared: That is…</p>

<p>HornetPissed: <font color="red"><b>...</b></font></p>

<p>PlugShocked: <strong>EEK!!</strong> Sorry, my friend but I ch-choose pirates.</p>

<p>Splash: <em>Sigh</em></p>

<p>HornetGlare: Good.</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: Hoi! May I chime in to the conversion?</p>

<p>SplashHappy: Yes!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: No.</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: Well, personally, I prefer Ninjas. They’re so sneaky and cool! They even have these cool little star throwing sharp thingies!</p>

<p>SplashHappy: Good! Glad someone agrees… even with a basic understanding.</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Hmph.</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: …</p>

<p>Hornet: …</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: …</p>

<p>HornetGlare: …</p>

<p>SplashAnnoyed: You know he isn’t gonna talk. Don’t bother.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>FakeHappy: Well, personally I prefer Pirate Ninjas!</p>

<p>Hornet: There’s no such thing!</p>

<p>FakeSnicker: Yes there is!</p>

<p>SplashAnnoyed: Ugh. Fakette, please don’t group up Ninjas with such disgraceful and hateful things…</p>

<p>Fake: I take it you don’t get along with Pirates, huh?</p>

<p>SplashAnnoyed: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>

<p>Hornet: Whatever! This conversation is over!</p>

<p>SplashAnnoyed: You just don’t wanna admit-</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Go home!</p>

<p>SplashAngry: Fine! I’m out! [heads back to his room]</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: Well, guess I’m gonna go do some grocery shopping.</p>

<p>Fake: …But you do this every day. We have so much food already!</p>

<p>GalaxyAnnoyed: Huh? You’re right but whatever!</p>

<div class="hhhh">As Galaxy Man heads out to the outdoors, Fakette turns to Hornet wanting to go back to the previous conversation</div>

<p>Fake: So… would you rather talk about the Wii U Classic Mini?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: But I thought they’ve stopped at the Gamecube.</p>

<p>FakeAnnoyed: Oh no. They’ve just actually decided to make a Classic Mini Edition of your favorite system.</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Piss off. I’ve hated it.</p>

<p>Fake: Ya sureee?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Yes.</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: …</p>

<p>Hornet: What’s in it.</p>

<p>FakeHappy: [holding a regular Wii U box with a paper taped onto it with written in a marker] 30 amazing games it says!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Bullshit. There’s only less than half of that.</p>

<p>FakeSnicker: Yeah? I bet you’ve never heard of Funky Barn!</p>

<p>Hornet: …How much are you willing to sell it for?</p>

<p>Fake: Uh… $500?</p>

<p>Hornet: <strong>Sold!</strong> [takes out his wallet and hands over his $500]</p>

<p>FakeShocked: O-Oh. Well, I didn’t expect an actual sale. Aheh…. [hands over the box]</p>

<p>Hornet: Whatever! Hooking it up now! [opens the box]</p>

<div class="hhhh">Suddenly Magma Man barges in from his trip outdoors.</div>

<p>Magma: Guess what!?</p>

<p>Hornet: Shut up! I’m trying to boot up the Wii U Classic Mini!!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: …Hmm, the mini system is the exact size as the original…</p>

<p>Magma: I’m now a pirate for no reason! Arrrr!! [pirate hat and eyepatch suddenly appears]</p>

<p>PlugHappy: Oh! Oh! Can I be a Pirate too? [pirate hat appears too] Yeah!</p>

<p>HornetAngry: WHAT!? WHAT ABOUT ME?! [same]</p>

<p>Hornet: FUCK YEAH!!!! [throws the GamePad out of the window]</p>

<p>GalaxyAngry: [gets hit in the head by the Mini GamePad] (x0x) <strong>KOed</strong></p>

<p>Magma: Arrr! Let’s find some lost treasure!!</p>

<p>Plug: Arrr!</p>

<p>Hornet: ARRR!!!</p>

<p>SpikeAnnoyed: [shakes head no position]</p>

<p>Plug: I don’t think Concrete Man likes fun.</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Yeah! What crawled up your ass and died!?</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: …</p>

<p>HornetAngry: You know what? EAT THIS!! <em>shoots out tons of killer bees towards him</em></p>

<p>SpikeAloof: [manages to rolls away successfully, but accidentally leaves behind a wishbone he had from a turkey dinner]</p>

<p>Hornet: Dammit!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Wait, what the hell did he just dropped?</p>

<p>PlugHappy: Oh, look! A wishbone! We can make a wish by snapping it in half!</p>

<p>Hornet: I want a pet parrot before we get a ship!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Yar! And I want a pirate ship for me journey!</p>

<p>PlugScared: But, a wishbone only grants one wish! So, whoever gets the longer piece gets their wish granted!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Oh what?! Well, I still want my wish!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: And we still need a pirate ship for our crew!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Then it’s on…!! [grabs the wishbone and holds it up in front of Magma Man]</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: [grabs the wishbone from the other side]</p>

<div class="hhhh">Both had a dramatic staredown right before pulling the wishbone to their direction. And... <b>SNAP!!</b></div>

<p>MagmaGiddy: YEAH! [holds the longer piece up]</p>

<p>HornetAngry: Fuck!</p>

<div class="hhhh">Suddenly right outside their lawn, the pirate ship appears from thin air in the sky!</div>

<p>GalaxyShocked: [wakes up and sees a pirate ship dropping onto the pool] (°o°) … <strong>(°ロ°)!</strong></p>

<p>PlugHappy: [peeks out the window] Wow, it really worked!!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: [peeks out the window] Yarr!! There it is, lads! All aboard the S.S. Magma!</p>

<p>HornetSad: Meh.</p>

<div class="hhhh">The three goes to board the ship, unknowingly with Galaxy Man curiously trailing behind them.</div>

<p>PlugShocked: This is bigger than I expected!</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Yeah. I think we might need a bigger crew than this.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Too bad everyone else preferred Ninjas…</p>

<p>MagmaAngry: Well they ain’t belonging to our crew for sure!!</p>

<p>Hornet: Exactly!</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: Hi.</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Ahoy!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Get lost!</p>

<p>Galaxy: Huh. I just wanted to see what you all are upto…</p>

<p>Hornet: You picked Ninjas! Get out!</p>

<p>Magma: Even if he did, look at it this way. He will realize the errors of his ways and become a true pirate!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: But you just… Ugh. <em>Fine…</em></p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Welcome to the crew, Galaxy Man!</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: Yay!!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: And now with that out of the way, I think we can do with the four of us for now! So it is time to set sail, lads! Arrr!!</p>

<p>PlugHappy: Arr!!</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: Arr!!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Arr…</p>

<div class="hhhh">The pirate ship slowly sails towards out of the pool and drags itself across the land, creating a huge earth-destroying trail behind.</div>
