<p>Galaxy: Wait, why have a <em>poop</em> deck when we have a toilet-</p>

<p>MagmaAngry: …</p>

<p>Galaxy: G…Get it? Get the pun?</p>

<p>MagmaAngry: …</p>

<p>GalaxyShocked: Nevermind! I didn’t say anything!!</p>

<p>Hornet: Hey, you chucklefucks! What am I suppose to do?!</p>

<p>Plug: Same.</p>

<p>Magma: Cranchio, you scout on the Crow’s Nest and tell us when there’s a threat nearby! We can’t afford to be unguarded out in the dangerous sea!</p>

<p>HornetAngry: HEY! I SAID WHAT ABOUT ME?!</p>

<p>Magma: Dunno, do whatever ya want.</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Ugh. I’m going to play the Wii U Classic then.</p>

<p>%Hornet Man then remembers he left the system at home</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Fuck.</p>

<p>Galaxy: Huh?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: This is so <em>boring</em>. Nothing exciting is even happening.</p>

<p>GalaxyAnnoyed: Dude, we’ve only just started sailing 3 minutes ago.</p>

<p>Hornet: Oh, shut your stupid annoying face.</p>

<p>GalaxyAngry: Hey!!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: I said shut up!</p>

<p>GalaxyPissed: (`д´#)</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Are you trying to scare me? Cuz’ it ain’t working motha fucka.</p>

<p>GalaxyPissed: o(-`д´- ｡)</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Still ain’t working!</p>

<p>GalaxyPissed: щ(ಠ益ಠщ)</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: STILL NOT WORKING!!!!!!</p>

<p>GalaxyAngry: (&gt;_&lt;)</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Wow, you just gave up there.</p>

<p>GalaxyPissed: THAT’S IT! ＼(｀0´)／ [takes out a pirate sword and stabs it through Hornet Man’s stomach twice]</p>

<p>HornetShocked: HURK!!!</p>

<p>GalaxyPissed: [grabs Hornet Man’s head and twists it to snap his neck]</p>

<p>HornetShocked: GACK [falls over dead]</p>

<p>%(That didn’t happen)</p>

<p>%<em>FWOOOSH</em></p>

<p>Hornet: Well…?</p>

<p>GalaxyPissed: ＼(｀0´)／ [tries stabbing him with the pirate sword but it shatters on impact instead]</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: …</p>

<p>GalaxyPissed: [grabs Hornet Man’s head and tries to twist it]</p>

<p>HornetGlare: …</p>

<p>GalaxyPissed: (ｏ`皿′ｏ)</p>

<p>Hornet: Get off!! [throws him into a barrel]</p>

<p>GalaxyAnnoyed: <em>glubglubglub</em></p>

<p>%The ship eventually reaches the city of Robotropolis, hitting a filled parking lot.</p>

<p>PlugScared: [at the crow’s nest] SACRE BLEU! We’re going to hit a bunch of boats!!!!</p>

<p>Hornet: Now we’re talking!!</p>

<p>MagmaShocked: [tries steering the ship] She’s refusin’ to turn, lads! Brace for impact!!</p>

<p>%The ship crushes parked cars in its way, all while drivers in their cars drive out of the way for their dear lives. The cars being crushed has their alarms goes off on impact, creating a lot of noise.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: I didn’t know boats could be so noisy.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: It’s starting to get on my nerves.</p>

<p>Civilian: Hey!! Watch where you’re going, jackass!!</p>

<p>Civilian2: GET OFF THE ROAD!!</p>

<p>Civilian3: My car!!! THAT WAS MY CAR!!</p>

<p>MagmaShocked: What was that?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: ‘unno. I guess some really chatty seagulls?</p>

<p>Galaxy: <em>glubglubglub</em></p>

<p>Hornet: I told ya to shut up!</p>

<p>GalaxyAngry: [tries to wiggle out of the barrel but to not avail] <em>glub…</em></p>

<p>Hornet: Ha ha ha ha!!</p>

<p>%Suddenly, police sirens are heard coming from behind the ship’s direction.</p>

<p>PlugAnnoyed: OH MON DIEU!!</p>

<p>Hornet: Now what?</p>

<p>PlugScared: This is not good I don’t think, but it looks like there’s rival pirate boats coming our way!</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Weird! Why would they use boats? They should be using a ship like ours!!!</p>

<p>PlugScared: [using the binoculars and sees the police cars gaining up and eventually getting near the sides of the ship] Oh non! Ai think they’re tryeng to get on ze ship!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Okay.</p>

<p>MagmaAngry: Let ‘em come. Sinistar HUNGERS!</p>

<p>%The police opens the top of their special vehicle, sending out police bots to grapple and climb onto the ship.</p>

<p>PlugScared: Here they come from both sides!!</p>

<p>Magma: Arrr! [draws out his sword] Alright, lads. Hornet, you take care of the right side, I take care of the left. Plug, you scout and let us know of any incoming attacks! And… where is Galaxy?</p>

<p>GalaxyAngry: [wiggles more and eventually gets the barrel knocked over to the ground]</p>

<p>HornetGlare: [looks at the moving barrel and then shrugs] Must be inspecting all of the rum or somethin’.</p>

<p>MagmaAngry: Ah, good for that lad. Looking out for our ship in such dire times!</p>

<p>Hornet: Yeah, we can take them on ourseives anyways!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Yer right. Arr! <strong>ATTACK!!!</strong></p>

<p>Hornet: Arr!!!</p>

<p>%Several groups of police bots makes it to both sides of the ship. Hornet and Magma Man rushes to their assigned sides to fend themselves off from the police bots.</p>

<p>Police Bot 1: We have our target on sight!</p>

<p>%All the police bots on the left side of the ship aims their gun at Magma Man</p>

<p>Magma: Arr, ye ain’t going to steal my ship and get my treasure! That’s one thing for certain! [aims both of his arm cannon at the police bots]</p>

<p>Police Bot 2: Uhhh…</p>

<p>Police Bot 3: It appears we’re fighting land pirates!</p>

<p>Police Bot 1: Well, we’re ready to fire, commander!</p>

<p>Police Commander Bot: [over at the intercom] What? Land pirates?! That’s just ridiculous! Whatever they are-</p>

<p><strong>FWOOOOM</strong></p>

<p>Police Bots: <strong>AUGHHHH!!!</strong></p>

<p>Police Commander Bot: [over at the intercom] What’s going on?! Over!</p>

<p>Police Bot 3: 2 men down! 2 men down! OH NO!</p>

<p><strong>FWOOOOOOOM</strong></p>

<p>Police Bot 4: EEK!</p>

<p>Magma: Ye’ll live. I’ve only disabled your weapons.</p>

<p>Police Bot 1: You’ve melted our guns!</p>

<p>Magma: Yes. Like I said-</p>

<p>Police Bot 2: THEY WERE OUR HANDS!!</p>

<p>Magma: Ye shouldn’t have messed with me pirate crew and now ye shall pay the price!</p>

<p>Police Bot 3: There’s more than the 4 of us here! You won’t get away with this!!</p>

<p>Hornet: Yo, sup?</p>

<p>[Magma and the 4 police bots look a large pile of destroyed police bots]</p>

<p>Police Bot 4: Eep!!</p>

<p>Magma: Aha! Great work there!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: They were nothing. Can I finish these idiots off?</p>

<p>Police Bot 1: N-no! We swear we’ll do anything!!</p>

<p>Police Bot 4: Please just don’t kill us!</p>

<p>Hornet: Hmmmm… Nah!</p>

<p>%Suddenly, a light from above shines on the ship!</p>

<p>MagmaShocked: The heck?!</p>

<p>HornetShocked: OW! MY EYES!</p>

<p>Police Bot 2: Back up!</p>

<p>Police Bot 3: We’re saved!</p>

<p>%6 more Police Bots parachutes from the helicopter above, all towards the spot where the 4 Police Bots are!</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Parachuting pirates…?!</p>

<p>Hornet: Oh goody, more carnage!</p>

<p>Police Bot 5: You’re outnumbered! 10 to 3!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Are you blind or are you stupid? Or both? We’ve took on larger numbers than 10, plus the 4 of your pals are already disarmed so that makes it 6 you stupid idiot!</p>

<p>Police Bot 6: Who’s to say we weren’t counting the 4 on the crow’s nest?</p>

<p>Police Bot 7: Yeah!</p>

<p>%Magma Man and Hornet Man looks at the crow’s nest where Plug Man, is surrounded by 4 Police Guard Bots.</p>

<p>Police Bot 8: If ya want your friend to get out of this alive, you should surrender!</p>

<p>Police Bot 9: No one can defeat the Robotropolis Po-</p>

<p>PlugAngry: [electricutes all the surrounding Police Guard Bots around him]</p>

<p>Police Guard Bots: <strong>AIEEEEEEEE!!!!</strong> [all off the crows nest and smashes on the floor]</p>

<p>PlugHappy: You can say these pirates were in quite a SHOCK, mon amis. [shrugs]</p>

<p>Police Bot 10: O-oh…</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Meh. [grabs a barrel]</p>

<p>Galaxy: <em>glub glub?</em></p>

<p>Hornet: [throws the barrel towards the group of 10 bots]</p>

<p>GalaxyShocked: <em>GLUB GLUB???</em></p>

<p>Police Bots: Yikes!</p>

<p>%As they’re about to run, the barrel strikes them all out like bowling pins.</p>

<p>GalaxyShocked: <em>GLUB GLUBBBBBBB…</em> [falls out of the ship]</p>

<p>Hornet: <strong>Strike!</strong></p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: What was that weird noise just now?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: No one important. Let’s finish this mess! [points at the police cars still chasing the ship]</p>

<p>MagmaAngry: Yeah! Let’s make sure they don’t come back!! [shoots several wave of magma at the police cars on the road]</p>

<p>Hornet: Yeah, destroy them all!! Hmhmhmhmhmhmhm!!! [sends swarm of bees towards the police cars as well]</p>

<p>%Several police cars explodes from the magma attack while the rest gets harassed by swarm of bees. The police force eventually loses momentum with the ship and eventually retreats.</p>

<p>PlugHappy: [looking at the road with the telescope] Looks like they’re all backing off now! We did it!!!!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Great job, ny crew! I’m proud of ye.</p>

<p>%The ship eventually makes its way out of the city and into the fields.</p>

<p>Hornet: Now it’s boring again! FUCK!</p>

<p>PlugHappy: Least we’re closer to le treasure now, right?</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: [holding the map] That we are! Those rival pirates were hardly a challenge either and nothing will stop us from getting our treasure! We will be the greatest pirates that has ever lived!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: What is the treasure anyways? You’ve never told us anything about it!</p>

<p>Magma: That’s the exciting part! I don’t know what’s the treasure!</p>

<p>Hornet: What? Are you serious?!</p>

<p>Magma: Yar! I know nothin’ about the treasure other than it’s right there [points at an abandoned warehouse on the map] in ye ol’ abandoned warehouse in the middle of nowhere!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Of all the-</p>

<p>PlugScared: Eep! [takes hands off of the telescope and points at the forest] Wé’re abut to cross zé mystairious green sea!</p>

<p>Magma: Looks like we’re about to cross the unknown territory, lads! Brace yourselves! [heads back to navigating the ship]</p>

<p>HornetGlare: …</p>
