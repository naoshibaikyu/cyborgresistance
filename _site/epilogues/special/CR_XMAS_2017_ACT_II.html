<!-- Epilogue Info -->

<p>@EPNUM: Cyborg Resistance’s Christmas Special</p>

<p>@TITLE: It’s Beginning to Look A Lot Like Sinimas</p>

<p>@AUTHOR: Written by <strong>Psycho The Mantis</strong> with Special Thanks to <strong>Sinistar</strong> and <strong>SilverDime</strong></p>

<!-- Epilogue -->

<p>@ACTNUM: ACT II</p>

<p>@LOCATION: Living Room</p>

<p>%Magma Man appears into the scene by sliding down the stairway’s rails and with his feet and does a double flip jump at the end of the rail then lands perfectly onto the living room floor.</p>

<p>TornadoHappy: <em>[holds up a “10” card]</em></p>

<p>JewelHappy: <em>[holds up a “10” card as well]</em></p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <em>[holds up a blank card]</em> …</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Oh come on! You’re even too lazy to write a number, Concrete?! Where is your Sinimas Spirit?</p>

<p>Jewel: Sinimas?</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Only the best holiday ever conceived in Sinistar-kind!</p>

<p>Jewel: What?</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Don’t tell me you’ve never heard of Sinimas!</p>

<p>Jewel: I don’t and what does that have to do with your trick?</p>

<p>TornadoAnnoyed: All confusion. Sinimas knowledge is required.</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Sure, it’s time to tell you a story… Sinimas is…</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: …a wonderful time where all the Sinistars come together and celebrate a festive day by eating space ships!</p>

<p>Jewel: …</p>

<p>TornadoAnnoyed: …</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: …</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: What?</p>

<p>Jewel: Pretty sure you’ve made it all up unless you have a secret cloning machine hidden somewhere in Dr. Light’s Lab. Also nothing of this sounds festive… at all!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Well, fine I made it all up on the spot.</p>

<p>JewelAnnoyed: I could tell…</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: But it doesn’t mean I can’t create the holiday myself! To the North Pole!</p>

<p>JewelShocked: Are you serious?</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: That’s right! I’m going to replace Christmas. What better way to introduce the world to Sinimas than replacing one of the biggest holidays of the country?! Ol’ St. Nicholas is gonna have a brand new PR for his holiday brand! Me!</p>

<p>JewelAnnoyed: Um, well have fun with that I guess.</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: <strong>YEAHHHH!!!</strong></p>

<p>%Magma Man dashes outside, gets in a flying vehicle and flies away.</p>

<p>TornadoAnnoyed: Still confusion. But also concern.</p>

<p>JewelAnnoyed: Wait, did he just took Dr. Light’s flying car?</p>

<p>@LOCATION: Hornet Man’s Bedroom</p>

<p>HornetSleep: Zzzz… Zzzzzzzzz……..</p>

<p>GhostPast: Heheheh…</p>

<p>GhostPast: BOO!</p>

<p>HornetShocked: <em>[immediately wakes up and sits up on his bed]</em> AUGH! What the?! <em>[turns to the ghost]</em> …</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Who the hell are you?</p>

<p>GhostPast: Hornet Mannnnnnnn… I am the one of the three ghosts that will visit you tonightttttt, I am Ghost of your Christmas Pastttttt…</p>

<p>Hornet: …</p>

<p>HornetGlare: So?</p>

<p>GhostPast: We are here to inform you of your misdeeeeeds and the terrible effects it will have on youuu and your loved oneeessss…</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Do you think I actually care?</p>

<p>GhostPast: No.</p>

<p>HornetShocked: Then stop bugging me. You’re just an annoying candle, so just go away before I’ll show you a <em>misdeed</em>.</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: And cut it out with your dumb ghostly act!</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: But wouldn’t you at least like to revisit your past? It’s right out of this door!</p>

<p>Hornet: Wait, we’re actually time traveling? You know what? Fine.</p>

<p>GhostPast: Follow me! <em>[bumps into the door]</em> Ooof! Uh, can you open the door? I have no hands…</p>

<p>%Hornet Man gets out of the bed and walks towards the door to open it. As he enters the living room, he sees it decorated with props and decorations while resembling an living room from many decades ago despite his young age. He then sees Splash Man who is just wearing a shoddy outfit representing Hornet Man from the past.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Wait a minute… <em>[looks at “young Hornet Man’s” fish legs]</em> Where are my legs?</p>

<p>PastHornet: …</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: Because bees aren’t born with legs!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: <em>[turns to the ghost]</em> Uhh, yeah they do!</p>

<p>GhostPast: No they don’t! Ever heard of evolution?! You’ll grow them later! <em>[gives a hand signal to Plug Man secretly]</em></p>

<p>Hornet: That’s not how evolution works!</p>

<p>PlugAnnoyed: <em>[tip toes in and tapes fake cardboard cutout of a pair of regular human legs onto Splash Man’s tail and tip toes out of the scene]</em></p>

<p>GhostPast: Yes it does! The proof is right there! Look!</p>

<p>PastHornetAnnoyed: <em>[suddenly wearing the cardboard cutout of legs]</em> I’ve just evolved. Wow.</p>

<p>GhostPast: Convinced now?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: …</p>

<p>Hornet: Yes, I guess so, I mean you’re been changing history by messing with time and space.</p>

<p>GhostPast: It’s not real time travel, we’re just in your subconscious! So you’re only visiting your old memories from an outsider perspective, which means no one here can really hear or see you.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: What?! Ugh! I wanna go back to my room then. No point if I can’t change history myself!</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: I’ve just told you we’re here to show your misdeeds and the consequences. Not screw with history, that’s against the point!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Wow, me being silent and doing absolutely nothing. The true sins of my past.</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: <em>[glares at Splash Man]</em></p>

<p>PastHornet: !</p>

<p>PastHornetAnnoyed: My name is Hornet Man and I smell really bad!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: …Hmmm…</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: …</p>

<p>Galaxy0Annoyed: <em>[behind a prop]</em> <strong>ahem</strong></p>

<p>PastHornetAnnoyed: Oh! Ha ha ha My name is Hornet Man and I am 5 years old and I am mean!! <em>[lazily smashes a bunch of empty chrismas gift boxes]</em></p>

<p>GhostPast: So… uh… Do you get it now?</p>

<p>Hornet: Yeah, I just need to take care of my personal hygiene more.</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: Erm…</p>

<p>Hornet: Look, I honestly don’t know what else is wrong here.</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: Really? Nothing else wrong your past self?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: I don’t see any god damned consequences now do I?</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: T…That’s why you have two more ghosts showing up later?</p>

<p>Hornet: Whatever, you’re just wasting my time at this point. So just go away and tell your ghostly idiots to not bother me either!</p>

<p>%Hornet Man walks back to his room and rests in his bed again.</p>

<p>Galaxy0Annoyed: I honestly can’t tell if we’re really just messing with him or we’re actually trying to help him…</p>

<p>FakeSnicker: <em>[poof]</em> Well I gotta pretend to care and be in character! Plus he seemed pretty annoyed there, so we’re accomplishing that!</p>

<p>PastHornet: I don’t know, if anything, I feel I’m the real unfortunate one. This is embarrassing!</p>

<p>FakeSnicker: Well you’ve agreed to this farce!</p>

<p>PastHornet: But I didn’t agree to wear <em>this</em>!</p>

<p>PlugAnnoyed: <em>[gets out of the big fake present box]</em> I guess it’s my turn…</p>

<p>@LOCATION: Somewhere in a snowy land…</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: <em>[walking through the barren landscape]</em> Curses! First the engine froze causing my vehicle to crash and now 50 miles in I’m still seeing no sight of the workshop!</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: Well, least it’s not cold enough to freeze my ever so burning body! Ha! And I am certain the workshop is still not too far from here!!</p>

<p>Chill: Hey, man.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Eh? Who may you be?</p>

<p>Chill: Just a forgotten member of an old defunct team… Never recognized and always missing in action.</p>

<p>MagmaSad: Oh… I’m so sorry.</p>

<p>Chill: Haha, nah. I don’t care, was just messing. Anyways, welcome to the South Pole. Population: Me. The name’s Chill Man.</p>

<p>MagmaShocked: South Pole?! I thought this was the North Pole!</p>

<p>Chill: Nope! You must’ve took the wrong turn and ended up here.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Darn it!! Who knew piloting in reverse would be such a terrible idea?</p>

<p>Chill: Hey, just chill… man. Haha!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Hahaha! Good one! High five!!</p>

<p>%Magma Man and Chill Man gives each other a five high. Right before their hands hit, Chill Man suddenly fades away…</p>

<p>MagmaShocked: Woah?!</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: <em>[looks around]</em> Man… Being stranded in such a frozen desert is really getting into me!</p>

<p>Magma: And if what my imaginary friend just said is true… how am I going to get out of this mess… Hmmm…</p>

<p>Hornet: Just dig to the other side, ya dumbass.</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: You’re right, mirage Hornet Man! Always a genius!</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: Oh man, this would create an awesome entrance. Surely Santa would hire such a cool guy such as ME!</p>

<p>%He takes out a huge drill and goes drilling in from the center of the South Pole.</p>

<p>%Part two, end.</p>
