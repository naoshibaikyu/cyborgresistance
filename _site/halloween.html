<p>@EPNUM: Halloween Special ‘19</p>

<p>@TITLE:</p>

<p>@AUTHOR: By Arrietty and Molly</p>

<!-- Epilogue -->

<p>@ACTNUM: ACT 1</p>

<p>@LOCATIONlightslab2: DR. LIGHT’S LAB</p>

<p>Arrietty: Pleaasssee?</p>

<p>Light: No.</p>

<p>Arrietty: Come on!!</p>

<p>Light: <strong>[sigh]</strong> I said no, it means no, Arrietty.</p>

<p>Arrietty: Seriously, what’s the problem?</p>

<p>Light: Because last year you all made a gigantic mess and it took poor Auto <em>weeks</em> to clean up the place.</p>

<p>Arrietty: What? Now you’re just making up excuses, we’ve only been living with you for a <em>few months</em> at most.</p>

<p>Light: Well, the answer is no and that is final.</p>

<p>Arrietty: Alright, fine. <strong>[slams the door on her way out]</strong> Stuck up old geezer, the heck is his problem lately?</p>

<p>MollySad: I take it Dr. Light didn’t take it well seeing you setting up the Halloween party, huh?</p>

<p>Arrietty: Yeah, so much effort for that… Guess we can try again next year.</p>

<p>MollyHappy: Not so fast! We can find somewhere else to party!</p>

<p>Arrietty: Huh? How should we go about that?</p>

<p>Molly: Easy! We find a really scary looking place and party there. Like a true Halloween party!</p>

<p>Arrietty: Scary looking place? Like a graveyard? A haunted castle? A haunted graveyard castle?</p>

<p>MollySmug: You aren’t scared, are you Arri?</p>

<p>Arrietty: Oh hell no, I am so down for that idea actually!</p>

<p>MollyHappy: Great! Let’s gather up a few folks and search for a scary party location, then we can party there!</p>

<p>Arrietty: I have someone in mind already. Hey, Dimey!</p>

<p>%Silver Dime splashes out of the Punch Bowl.</p>

<p>MollyShocked: <strong>[startled]</strong> <em>Y-YAGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!</em></p>

<p>OniSilver: <strong>[all calm and collected]</strong> Greetings. How may I assist you?</p>

<p>MollyAnnoyed: <strong>[clutching her chest, calming herself]</strong> N-Next time please have a less startling entrance…</p>

<p>OniSilverHappy: My apologies, Molly. I have been practicing my scare as a fearsome Oni.</p>

<p>Arrietty: It sure seem to have worked on her. <strong>[giggles]</strong></p>

<p>Arrietty: Anyways, Dimey… Would you like to help the both of us find a totally spooky place for our party?</p>

<p>OniSilver: My scouting would provide enough to find us such a place. I’m more than glad to be of your assistance.</p>

<p>MollyHappy: Great! I’ll rally up the rest of the team.</p>

<p>Arrietty: Great idea, and I’ll ask Roy to drive us. Let’s throw us one killer Halloween Party!</p>

<p>%End of Act 1</p>

<p>@ACTNUM: ACT 2</p>

<p>@LOCATION: ABANDONED ROUTE</p>

<p>%As Dr. Light have disallowed Cyborg Resistance from throwing a party at their place, everyone has agreed that Arrietty and co should find a new party location for the whole team. However, Roy Jackson, the team’s Magma Man and also their driver, only agrees to help out under the condition the search doesn’t take too long as the rest of the team needs to finish their last minute costume shopping.</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: <strong>[holding her map filled with dozens of locations marked red crosses]</strong> Well, this one has to be it then. Let’s stop at this place. <strong>[points at an unmarked cemetary with an abandoned mysterious building]</strong></p>

<p>Magma0: This is lookin’ to be the last stop, alright. The second time we doubled back to the first three stops really drained this thing’s juice!</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: Whoops! Sorry that I’ve gotten a little carried away!</p>

<p>Magma0Annoyed: That’s alright, kiddo; this thing was built for racing, it’s not quite used to chauffeuring yet. Gonna have to give ol’ Cerberus’ car battery a tune-up after I drop the others off at the mall.</p>

<p>OniSilver: I take it us three are the only ones prepared ahead of time?</p>

<p>UlalaMolly: I don’t see you wearing anything right now, though.</p>

<p>OniSilverHappy: Of course I am. I’m an Oni this year.</p>

<p>UlalaMollyAnnoyed: …By just gluing two large candy corns on your forehead?</p>

<p>OniSilverHappy: It is an effective low-cost Halloween costume.</p>

<p>UlalaMollyAnnoyed: I see…</p>

<p>%Soon, the team finally arrives at what is hopefully their ideal destination.</p>

<p>UlalaMollyHappy: Oh! There it is!</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: Look at the size of that castle!</p>

<p>UlalaMollyShocked: C-Castle?! You didn’t say there would be an abandoned castle!</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: Oh, now are you chickening out?</p>

<p>UlalaMolly: Don’t be silly. T-that’s awesome! Totally our s-spot!</p>

<p>Magma0Annoyed: Now what in the- what’s a castle doing out here? Do you folks think it’s… <em>haunted</em> or somethin’?</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: <strong>[Getting off of the car with Molly and Silver]</strong> Don’t know, but we’re going to investigate this place to make sure it’s all good.</p>

<p>Magma0: Alright, don’t get too scared! I’ll come back with the rest of the team when they’re done shopping. Be safe you three!</p>

<p>%With that, Roy’s car speeds off the scene, leaving the three at a huge graveyard with the castle in its surrounding. Soon, the three walk across the graveyard approaching the castle.</p>

<p>UlalaMollySad: <strong>[looking around the surroundings, surveying a very unsettling atmosphere]</strong> This is looking like w-what we’ve wanted, huh?</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: <strong>[pumps fist into the air]</strong> Heck yeah! I can already feel a chill down my spine! Are you as excited as I am?</p>

<p>UlalaMollyHappy: O-Of course! This was my idea after all! <strong>[shudders]</strong></p>

<p>UlalaMollySad: …But you know, despite that. Since we’re walking through a graveyard now, this does feel a pretty amoral idea.</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: Now that you’ve mention it, I guess it is a little disrespectful to the dead. But hey, more excuses for a party in the spooky castle instead!</p>

<p>UlalaMollyAnnoyed: That doesn’t make it much better!</p>

<p>OniSilver: <strong>[surveying the area around himself]</strong> I sense this place has not seen any visitors in a while.</p>

<p>UlalaMolly: Even the worn down castle aside?</p>

<p>OniSilver: <strong>[nods]</strong> Not a single grave we’ve passed so far are dated within the past several decades…</p>

<p>UlalaMollyShocked: <strong>[Reading the year date of each passing tombstone, confirming Silver Dime’s claims]</strong> O-oh… How about that?</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: Oh, good observation! That might be a long abandoned graveyard then.</p>

<p>OniSilver: That is correct.</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: Which means no one’s ever around, we can party as long as we want!</p>

<p>UlalaMollyAnnoyed: Yeahhhh, I don’t think that was his point.</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: What was it then?</p>

<p>OniSilverHappy: It was just a simple observation. Nothing more.</p>

<p>UlalaMolly: Oh…</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: You’re acting awfully strange right now. You don’t think there’s actually ghosts or the like do you, Molly? I mean, not that I would complain.</p>

<p>UlalaMollyHappy: Of course not! T-That’s not scientific at all! Why would I believe in such silly supernatural non-sense?</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: Oh man, that would be <em>so</em> cool though! We’d be having the Halloween adventure of a life time!</p>

<p>UlalaMollySad: Hahaha… <em>Really</em> into the Halloween spirit, Arri?</p>

<p>%Eventually, they’ve finally reach to the ends of the grave yard and are right at the entrance of the castle.</p>

<p>WitchArrietty: Well, there it is!</p>
