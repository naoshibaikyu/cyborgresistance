ACT II
</h1></center></div>

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Living Room</div>

<div class="narration">
Magma Man appears into the scene by sliding down the stairway's rails and with his feet and does a double flip jump at the end of the rail then lands perfectly onto the living room floor.
</div>

<p>TornadoHappy: <em>[holds up a “10” card]</em></p>

<p>JewelHappy: <em>[holds up a “10” card as well]</em></p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <em>[holds up a blank card]</em> …</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Oh come on! You’re even too lazy to write a number, Concrete?! Where is your Sinimas Spirit?</p>

<p>Jewel: What’s a Sinimas?</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Only the best holiday ever conceived in Sinistar-kind!</p>

<p>TornadoAnnoyed: What?</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Don’t tell me you’ve never heard of Sinimas!</p>

<p>TornadoAnnoyed: Confusion. We want Sinimas knowledge to be acquired.</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: It’s a wonderful time where all the Sinistars come together and celebrate a festive day by eating space ships!</p>

<p>Jewel: …</p>

<p>TornadoAnnoyed: …</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: What?</p>

<p>Jewel: For starters, there’s several holidays this month and I’m certain Sinimas is not one of them!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Well, there should be if there isn’t one on this planet! It’s time to change things up. Sinimas isn’t going to start itself! To the North Pole!</p>

<p>JewelShocked: North Pole?!</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: That’s right! I’m going to replace Christmas. What better way to introduce the world to Sinimas than replacing one of the biggest holidays of the country?! Ol’ St. Nicholas is gonna have a brand new PR for his holiday brand! Me!</p>

<p>JewelAnnoyed: Um, have fun with that I guess.</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: YEAHHHH!!!</p>

<div class="narration">
Magma Man dashes outside, gets in a flying vehicle and flies away.
</div>

<p>TornadoAnnoyed: Still confusion. But also concern.</p>

<p>JewelAnnoyed: Wait, did he just took Dr. Light’s flying car?</p>

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Hornet Man's Bedroom</div>

<p>HornetSleep: Zzzz… Zzzzzzzzz……..</p>

<p>GhostPast: Heheheh…</p>

<p>GhostPast: BOO!</p>

<p>HornetShocked: <em>[immediately wakes up and sits up on his bed]</em> AUGH! What the?! <em>[turns to the ghost]</em> …</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Who the hell are you?</p>

<p>GhostPast: Hornet Mannnnnnnn… I am the Ghost of your Christmas Pastttttt…</p>

<p>Hornet: …</p>

<p>HornetGlare: So?</p>

<p>GhostPast: We are here for your misdeeds and poor character… We the three ghosts have come with a warninggg…</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Really? Then where’s the other ghosts?</p>

<p>GhostPast: They will arrive laterrrr, one by oneeee….</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Do you think I actually care?</p>

<p>GhostPast: No.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Then stop bugging me. You’re just an annoying candle, so just go away before I’ll show you a misdeed. And cut it out with your ghostly act, dumbass.</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: But wouldn’t you at least like to revisit your past? It’s right out of this door!</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: You know what? Fine.</p>

<p>GhostPast: Follow me! <em>[bumps into the door]</em> Ooof! Uh, can you open the door? I have no hands…</p>

<div class="narration">
Hornet Man gets out of the bed and walks towards the door to open it. As he enters the living room, he sees it decorated with props and decorations while resembling an living room from many decades ago despite his young age. He then sees Splash Man who is just wearing a shoddy outfit representing Hornet Man from the past.
</div>

<p>HornetGlare: Wait a minute… <em>[looks at young Hornet Man’s lack of legs]</em> Where are my legs?</p>

<p>PastHornet: …</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: Because bees aren’t born with legs!</p>

<p>Hornet: <em>[turns to the ghost]</em> Uhh, yeah they do!</p>

<p>GhostPast: No they don’t! Ever heard of evolution?! You’ll grow them later! <em>[gives a hand signal to Plug Man secretly]</em></p>

<p>HornetGlare: That’s not how evolution works.</p>

<p>PlugAnnoyed: <em>[tip toes in and tapes fake cardboard cutout of a pair of regular human legs onto Splash Man’s tail and tip toes out of the scene]</em></p>

<p>GhostPast: Yes it does! The proof is right there! Look!</p>

<p>PastHornetAnnoyed: <em>[suddenly wearing the cardboard cutout of legs]</em> I’ve just evolved. Wow.</p>

<p>GhostPast: Convinced now?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: …</p>

<p>HornetAnnoyed: Yes, I guess if you’ve been changing history by messing with time and space.</p>

<p>GhostPast: No one can see or hear us, though! It’s not real time travel, we’re just in your subconcious! So you’re only experiencing old memories.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: What?! Ugh! I wanna go back to my room then. No point if I can’t change history myself!</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: I’ve just told you we’re here to show your misdeeds. Not to change the past! That’s the whole point!</p>

<p>Hornet: Wow, me being silent and doing absolutely nothing. The true sins of my past!</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: <em>[glares at Splash Man]</em></p>

<p>PastHornet: !</p>

<p>PastHornetAnnoyed: My name is Hornet Man and I smell really bad!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: …Hmmm…</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: …</p>

<p>GalaxyAnnoyed: <em>[behind a prop]</em> <strong>ahem</strong></p>

<p>PastHornetAnnoyed: Oh! Ha ha ha My name is Hornet Man and I am 5 years old and I am mean!! <em>[lazily smashes a bunch of empty xmas boxes]</em></p>

<p>GhostPast: So… uh… Do you get it now?</p>

<p>Hornet: Yeah, I just need to take care of my personal hygene more.</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: Erm…</p>

<p>Hornet: Look, I honestly don’t know what else is wrong here.</p>

<p>GhostPastAnnoyed: Really? Nothing else wrong your past self?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Yes and you’re just wasting my time at this point. So just go away and tell your ghostly idiots to not bother either!</p>

<div class="narration">
Hornet Man walks back to his room and rests in his bed again.
</div>

<p>GalaxyAnnoyed: I honestly can’t tell if our goal is to annoy him or actually help him…</p>

<p>FakeSnicker: <em>[poof]</em> Well I gotta pretend to care and be in character! Plus he seemed pretty annoyed there, so we’re accomplishing what we wanted most!</p>

<p>PastHornet: I don’t know, if anything, I feel I’m the unfortunate one.</p>

<p>FakeSnicker: Well you’ve agreed to this farce!</p>

<p>PastHornet: But I didn’t agree to wear <em>this</em>!</p>

<p>PlugAnnoyed: <em>[gets out of the big fake present box]</em> I guess it’s my turn…</p>

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>Somewhere in a snowy land...</div>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: <em>[walking through the barren landscape]</em> Curses! First the engine froze causing my vehicle to crash and now 50 miles in I’m still seeing no sight of the workshop!</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: Well, least it’s not cold enough to freeze my ever so burning body! Ha! And I am certain the workshop is still not too far from here!!</p>

<p>Chill: Hey, man.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Eh? Who may you be?</p>

<p>Chill: Just a forgotten member of an old defunct team… Never recognized and always missing in action.</p>

<p>MagmaSad: Oh…</p>

<p>Chill: Haha, nah. I don’t care. I was so lazy and was never there for them. Anyways, welcome to the South Pole. Population: Me</p>

<p>MagmaShocked: South Pole?! I thought this was the North Pole!</p>

<p>Chill: Nope. You must’ve took the wrong turn and ended up here.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Darn it!! Who knew piloting in reverse would be such a terrible idea?</p>

<p>Chill: Hey, just chill… man. Haha!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Hahaha! Good pun! High five!!</p>

<div class="narration">
Magma Man and Chill Man gives each other a five high. Right before their hands hit, Chill Man suddenly fades away...
</div>

<p>MagmaShocked: Woah?!</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: <em>[looks around]</em> Man… Being stranded in such a frozen desert is really starting to get into me!</p>

<p>Magma: And if what my imaginary friend just said is true… how am I going to get out of this mess… Hmmm…</p>

<p>Hornet: Just dig to the other side, ya dumbass.</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: You’re right, mirage Hornet Man! Always a genius!</p>

<p>MagmaGiddy: Oh man, this would create an awesome entrance. Surely Santa would hire such a cool guy such as ME!</p>

<div class="narration">
He takes out a huge drill and goes drilling in from the center of the South Pole.
